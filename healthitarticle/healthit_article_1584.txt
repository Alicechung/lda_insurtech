CMS Seeks Comment on PCMH, Care Coordination, ACOs

February 20, 2015 - The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is seeking public comment on its advanced primary care models intended to provide better care coordination, more personalized attention, and better overall population health management throughout the healthcare system.
As part of ongoing efforts to develop innovative methods of improving healthcare, CMS is hoping to hear directly from healthcare providers about benefits, drawbacks, complications, and necessary improvements to practice architecture based on the principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH).
“Next generation model(s) for advanced primary care would seek to improve further the delivery of patient-centered care and population health and would align with the Secretary’s goal to increase the use of alternative payment models,” the request says.
“CMS seeks broad input from consumers and consumer organizations, health care providers, associations, purchasers and health plans, Medicaid agencies and other state offices, quality review organizations, social service providers, HIT vendors, and other stakeholders.”

CMS is particularly hoping to hear from the healthcare community about the following subjects:
• Developing closer alignment and care coordination between primary care providers and other healthcare entities that will improve the comprehensiveness of patient care
• Leveraging new value-based payment models and accountable care arrangements to improve population health management, create incentives for preventative care, and promote accountability
• Supporting the sustainability of small primary care practices, engaging payers, and fostering advanced primary care within accountable care organizations
• Using clinical analytics, care quality metrics, and electronic health records to better measure the impact of advanced care models and outcomes-based incentives
Stakeholders who wish to comment on the care coordination proposals can email APC@cms.hhs.gov with “RFI” as the subject line.  Questions within the document can help providers focus their responses. Answers may be posted publicly by CMS.  All responses must be received by March 16, 2015.

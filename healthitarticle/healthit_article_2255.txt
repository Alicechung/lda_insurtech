athenahealth lends analytics power to furloughed CDC

October 04, 2013 - With nearly 70% of the staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) twiddling their thumbs on furlough this week, the flu and other public health threats are going unmonitored and unreported.  EHR and practice management vendor athenahealth is taking up the reins by lending its big data power to the gutted agency, volunteering to track and report population health information while the political standoff drags on.
“Like a lot of people, we were very disturbed when we learned the CDC had furloughed 68 percent of its workforce and suspended flu- monitoring activities,” said Josh Gray, Vice President of athenaResearch at athenahealth.  “Because we can monitor activity in real time, we thought we were in a position to help.  The CDC normally provides weekly reports on flu activity across the country. This information is critical to effectively track outbreaks and encourage public vaccination.
“Every season is unpredictable,” he added.  “We hope the CDC is restored to full capacity as soon as possible. In the meantime we’ll leverage athenahealth’s cloud-based technology to report on disease patterns across our national network.”
The CDC told the Boston Globe that they were not familiar with athenahealth’s work in the industry, and that there was no one currently on staff to investigate the company and its plans.  “We welcome anyone who can crunch the numbers and share them with us,” said Barbara Reynolds, a CDC spokesperson.  Gray noted that attempts to contact the CDC to coordinate their efforts went unanswered, due to the agency’s shutdown.

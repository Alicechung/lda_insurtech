October 08, 2014 - Providers now have a new clinical data registry option to use for CMS Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) attestation, announced The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and National Bone Health Alliance (NBHA) Osteoporosis Quality Improvement Registry (QIR).  In partnership with CECity, Inc., the societies have developed the first Qualified Clinical Data Registry (QCDR) focused on recording outcomes for patients with osteoporosis and bone fractures.
The registry will help providers analyze their own interventions and identify gaps in care for patients with bone health issues as well as flag patient outliers and manage population health.  The registry can also be used to satisfy the Stage 2 meaningful use menu measure requiring the submission of data to a specialized registry.
“A key advantage of participating in PQRS through the Osteoporosis QIR is that CMS has permitted the use of not only PQRS-approved measures, but also new non-PQRS measures,” the press release states. “This provides the opportunity for NOF and NBHA to develop and deploy new performance measures through the Osteoporosis QIR that the profession believes best represent how quality should be measured based on specialty, practice setting, or other criteria.”

Healthcare Analytics Outsourcing to Grow at 8.6% CAGR

December 30, 2014

By Jennifer Bresnick
December 30, 2014 - Healthcare analytics and health IT outsourcing will be a prime area of growth for vendors and developers as organizations seek to implement advanced data analytics technologies without investing heavily in their own infrastructure, according to a Reportstack market brief.  The global health IT outsourcing market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.60% between 2014 and 2019 as third-party vendors take advantage of the growing interest in big data.
Key vendors in the space include Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Accenture, and IBM, the report says, as companies develop analytics-as-a-service technologies.  IBM has become notable in the field as it monetizes its Watson supercomputer, offering cloud services for clinical decision support and data visualization, among other tools.
Healthcare providers have started to look towards outsourcing as an important way to gain analytics insights and tackle upcoming mandates without breaking the bank.  Black Book Rankings recently estimated that the revenue cycle outsourcing market will reach $9.9 billion by the middle of 2016 as organizations prepare for ICD-10, while 71% of hospitals have enlisted an outside partner for clinical documentation improvement ahead of the new code set as a way to relieve the pressure of meeting the 2015 deadline.

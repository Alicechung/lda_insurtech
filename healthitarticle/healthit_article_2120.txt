January 09, 2014 - The University at Buffalo, part of New York State’s SUNY system, has partnered with the recently formed New York Genome Center (NYGC), located in Manhattan, to advance research into genomics and personalized medicine for the discovery and treatment of serious diseases.
“This important effort draws on many of our greatest assets as a premier research university – including our outstanding faculty, our reputation as a powerhouse in life sciences research and our considerable strength in supercomputing and medical information technology.  With this trifecta of resources, UB is an ideal partner to transform medical diagnosis and treatment,” said UB President Satish K. Tripathi.
Researchers from the Center for Computational Excellence, New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Sciences and Institute for Healthcare Informatics, housed on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, will help NYGC analyze big data to uncover and test new approaches to treatment for public health threats like diabetes and heart disease.  Genomic medicine will help physicians identify patients at risk and tailor therapies to the individual DNA signature of a patient.
UB will receive $50 million to fund the effort and expand its capabilities to pursue the collaboration. “This is exactly the type of public-private partnership that can lead to medical breakthroughs and innovations originating from New York State,” said Alexander N. Cartwright, UB vice president for research and economic development.  “UB’s expertise and strong track record in big data analytics and biomedical research makes us the ideal partner to help lead this effort.”

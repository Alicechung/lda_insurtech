March 07, 2018 - UnitedHealth Group recently announced its collaboration with healthcare providers, health systems, and government that will include offering health data analytics coordination tied to the growing use of bundled payment models in Medicare.
UnitedHealth will deliver data and analytics, technology, and care coordination to healthcare providers, including those participating in the CMS Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced program when it launches later this year.
Bundled payment models set price and quality standards for certain treatments and reward providers who exceed those standards. This form of value-based care benefits both providers and patients and is a shift away from traditional fee-for service structures.

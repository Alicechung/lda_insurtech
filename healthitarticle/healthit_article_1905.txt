August 06, 2014 - 23andMe, the home genetics testing company under scrutiny from the FDA, has secured the good will of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with a $1.4 million grant to develop its genetic database for expanded research and analytics.
The Google-backed company will offer its databank to external researchers, Reuters reports, focusing on growing its cache of diseases and traits for more than 400,000 customers as it awaits FDA approval to continue selling its $99 at-home DNA test.
The funding will go towards developing web-based surveying tools to collect data on genetic associations and develop a broader spectrum of genome sequencing data.
The company, founded by Anne Wojcicki, a Yale-educated biologist and wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, also recently announced its participation in new research into Parkinson’s disease.  Published in the journal Nature Genetics, the largest Parkinson’s genome wide association study to date, utilized 23andMe data from nearly 70,000 customers to identify previously unknown genetic markers associated with the disease.

23andMe is currently waiting FDA approval of its home DNA test before it can continue selling its flagship product.*
*Editor’s note: A spokesperson for 23andMe has indicated that the company received no such order to stop selling its genetic testings services. “23andMe has continued to offer its Personal Genome Service. This includes continuing to offer ancestry information, as well as access to raw health data without interpretation,” states the company.

Educational text message reminders significantly improved the likelihood of a child receiving the second vaccination on time.
January 06, 2015 - A study published in The Official Journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, determined that sending parents educational text message reminders to bring their child back to their physician to get their second dose of the influenza vaccine significantly improved the likelihood of the child receiving the second vaccination on time.
The study included 660 Latino children from three different clinics in New York City.. Each child was randomly assigned a type of text message which would be sent as a reminder to their parent or guardian.
Written reminders were presented to parents or guardians of each vaccinated child at their enrollment with the next dose date included. Conventional text messages contained the next dose date, and clinic walk-in hours. Educational text messages also included the dose date as well as additional information about the importance of their child receiving the second dose of the vaccination.
The study revealed that parents that received educational text messages were 72.7 percent more likely to bring their child to get their second vaccination on time. Children whose parents received conventional text messages got their second dose vaccination on time 66.7 percent of the time, and written-only children received their vaccinations by the due date 57.1 percent of the time.

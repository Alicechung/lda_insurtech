Providers fight hypertension in Million Hearts Challenge

February 11, 2014

February 11, 2014 - Nine providers are being recognized by HHS and the CDC for their fight against uncontrolled hypertension after winning the 2013 Million Hearts Hypertension Control Challenge.  With more than 8.3 million adult patients under their care, the providers from all over the country received applause for bringing their hypertension control up to a rate of between 73 and 90 percent.  With more than a third of the US population suffering from high blood pressure and fewer than half of these patients taking steps to monitor and reduce the condition, vigilance has become increasingly important to providers seeking to preempt dangerous cardiovascular conditions before they manifest as catastrophic events.
“These practices have set up systems that work for patients and for providers. They use evidence-based guidelines and protocols, team-based care, electronic reminders to track patients’ progress, and recognize high-performing staff,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, MD, MPH.  “By following their lead, we can help millions more Americans with high blood pressure get control. Controlling blood pressure saves lives and prevents disability from avoidable heart attacks and strokes.”
A flurry of activity around heart health and stroke prevention has produced new guidelines and risk calculators for patients, as well as incentives for providers to lower hypertension levels and improve overall population health.  The Hypertension Control winners represent both rural and urban populations, both of which face their own unique challenges of diet, physical activity, co-existing chronic conditions, and access to healthcare.
The champions were asked to demonstrate their performance using the National Quality Forum (NQF)-endorsed 0018 measure or a similarly validated method.  The measure captures the percentage of patients 18-85 years of age who had a diagnosis of hypertension and whose blood pressure was adequately controlled during the measurement year, the press release explains.

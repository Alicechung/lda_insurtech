May 27, 2014 - Central and South American populations affected by endemic diseases like Chagas’ disease and dengue fever will be the target of new research projects from the University of California San Francisco, UC Berkeley, and other partner institutions thanks to a $6 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Instituto Carlos Slim de la Salud.  The Fighting Infections through Research, Science, and Technology (FIRST) collaboration will bring population health management techniques and clinical analytics to some of the most seriously poverty-stricken communities in Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, and other Central and South American regions.
“We are selecting projects that will give us quick wins, allowing us to make a huge impact immediately, as well as game-changing, high-risk research that will make a significant impact in the long term,” said Jaime Sepulveda, MD, MPH, MSc, DrSc, the executive director of UCSF Global Health Sciences.
Chagas’ disease, caused by a parasite and often asymptomatic and difficult to track, is a leading cause of heart failure throughout South and Central America, while dengue is the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world, infecting close to 100 million people every year.  With no effective vaccines to stem the disease and few reliable treatments, dengue represents a crucial opportunity for researchers.
The FIRST project will focus on creating low-cost diagnostic tools for dengue, less toxic drugs and better biomarkers to tackle Chagas’ disease, and new information technology systems to pinpoint outbreaks and manage overall population health.

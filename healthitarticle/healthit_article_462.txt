May 19, 2017 - The CancerLinQ oncology data repository is steadily expanding its ability to use big data analytics to deliver meaningful clinical decision support to providers at the point of care.  The latest step in its evolution is a newly announced partnership with the American Academy of PAs (AAPA), which will bring an additional component of the cancer care team into the fold.
"By partnering with the AAPA, we are now bringing another facet of the cancer care team, the PAs, into our growing collaborative network," said CancerLinQ LLC Chief Executive Officer Kevin Fitzpatrick.
"PAs will provide valuable thought leadership on how data analysis through CancerLinQ can lead to improvements in care at the practice level. Having graduated from the Duke PA program, our formal collaboration with the AAPA is especially meaningful to me."

More than 115,000 certified physician assistants across all medical specialties operate as important components of care teams, said the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO), which oversees the CancerLinQ platform.
As part of the new collaboration, AAPA members will contribute their feedback to the ongoing development of the platform and will have the option of using the system’s clinical discovery tools to improve patient care quality.
CancerLinQ Discovery draws on the system’s vast stores of patient data – the platform hit the 1 million patient mark in the second half of 2016 – to give users insights into patient experiences and outcomes.
"AAPA is pleased to partner with CancerLinQ to help advance important research that will ultimately improve patient care," said Josanne K. Pagel, MPAS, PA-C, president and board chair of AAPA.
"PAs are on the forefront of using data in ways that enhance and improve healthcare, and on behalf of the profession we are pleased to be involved in this very important opportunity."
CancerLinQ has also established partnerships with a number of professional societies and organizations across the continuum of cancer care, including the American Society of Radiation Oncology, Cancer Informatics for Cancer Centers, College of American Pathologists, Hematology/Oncology Pharmacy Association, and the Oncology Nursing Society.
A number of pharmaceutical companies, patient advocacy groups, and individual donors have also contributed input and supported the development of the big data analytics platform.

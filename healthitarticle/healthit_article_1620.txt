Obama Asks for $1.2B to Fight Hospital Acquired Infections

January 27, 2015 - In his annual budget request, President Obama will ask Congress for $1.2 billion to fight hospital acquired infections produced by superbugs, the antibiotic-resistant bacteria that are responsible for tens of thousands of deaths each year.  With antibiotic stewardship becoming a hot topic among hospitals forking over financial penalties for preventable infections, the funding would provide a significant platform for healthcare providers to continue battling their insidious foe.
The Washington Post reports that the request would double current funding levels for reducing the impact of superbugs, and would be put towards research for new, more effective drugs, as well as developing improved surveillance and diagnostic tools.  About half of the money would be destined for the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to speed research into more impactful therapies.
If Congress agrees to the proposal, the CDC would also receive funding to reduce over-prescribing of antibiotics, a problem identified in more than three-quarters of hospitals late last year, while the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs would share around $130 million to reduce preventable hospital acquired infections in military healthcare settings.

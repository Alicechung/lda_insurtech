Colorado providers invest $63M in personalized medicine

April 21, 2014 - Personalized medicine and applied genomics are more than just pie-in-the-sky ideas in Colorado.  A partnership between University of Colorado Health (UCHealth), the University of Colorado School of Medicine, and Children’s Hospital Colorado will be investing more than $63 million over the next five years to bring in specialized clinicians, genetic experts, advanced data warehousing, and clinical analytics infrastructure to support a new vision of how high-risk patients are diagnosed and treated.  The Denver Post reports that the newly-formed Center for Personalized Medicine and Biomedical Informatics will develop a DNA databank while paying special attention to patient privacy and other critical issues.
“There is no doubt in my mind that this will change how we treat disease, how we teach our students, how physicians work, how we raise our kids and how we conduct public health policy,” said Dr. David Schwartz, chair of the CU Department of Medicine.
“We’re marrying our academic program and progressive community hospitals,” added UCHealth interim CEO Dr. William Neff. “We’ve got some great separate pieces — education, research, clinical — and we’re trying to integrate them. It’s critical to have a fully integrated electronic record system, and it’s a really hard thing to do. It’s a technology and culture shift.”
The Center will collect and sequence DNA samples from patients across the region, identifying genetic factors that may help patients respond better to certain drugs to treat cancer or other diseases, joining a number of new initiatives cropping up around the nation to tackle the thorny issues of personalized genetic care.

Washington University of St. Louis recently received an $8 million grant to study the relationship between genomics, cardiovascular disease, and lifestyle factors, while the Stanford Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences has been granted $45.3 million to pursue disease diagnostics, population health, and genomic research to advance clinical informatics and disease prevention.  Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City and the Kaiser Permanente system have also embarked on large-scale DNA collection programs, hoping to compile enough data to provide researchers with new insights into tailored treatments and genetic predispositions to serious conditions.
“It’s just this playground of incredibly rich data,” said Nobel laureate Elizabeth Blackburn of the University of California, San Francisco.  Kaiser Permanente has collected saliva samples from more than 100,000 patients in an effort to detect risk factors for heart disease, hypertension, and other chronic conditions.  “We’re just scratching the surface.”

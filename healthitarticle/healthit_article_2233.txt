In healthcare analytics, real-time data tops the wish list

October 21, 2013

October 21, 2013 - What will most hospital executives be asking for this Christmas?  Influenza for the auditors, extra arms for the physicians, and a comprehensive, real-time data analytics dashboard that can synthesize clinical, financial, and predictive risk scores for patients network-wide.  It may be a little early in the season to hope for presents, but a new survey by analytics vendor Vitria shows that the ability to gather data from diverse sources and analyze it in real time is a competency increasingly sought after by executives who are starting to recognize the value their data sets hold.
While polling attendees of two recent big data conferences working in a variety of sectors, including healthcare, researchers found that 94% believe that the ability to integrate multiple streams of data into an analytics algorithm is vital to the success of a data-driven organizations.  Faster decision making, increased operational efficiency, and better customer experience were the top reasons to invest in analytics.  Seventy-seven percent wanted to include historical data, and 63% added that being able to take immediate action is moderately to very important for their businesses.
And by “immediate,” they really do mean instantly.  More than half of respondents want to be able to take data from computer screen to action within minutes, with only 18% believing that they could wait more than a day or two for results.  When it comes to healthcare, these numbers aren’t very surprising.  Critically ill patients can go from stable to crisis in seconds, and acting quickly on fluctuating vital signs or changes in blood work can be the difference between life and death.  But while the majority of IT managers and executive participants realize the necessity of instantaneous analytics, few organizations have the capabilities yet.
Two thirds acknowledged that their organizations had little or no infrastructure to handle real-time data, and 30% admitted that they don’t have any analytics framework at all.  Of the organizations that did have some capabilities, 44% were cobbled-together solutions from different vendors, and 14% were internally developed.  The responsibility for investing in and promoting analytics lies with the C-suite executives, according to 47% of the participants, suggesting that at the moment, big data is a top-down initiative.

“IT organizations that are striving to deliver actionable insight in seconds or minutes to their business counterparts should take stock of their analytics architecture,” the report suggests.  “Consider complementing your existing enterprise business intelligence (BI), data warehouse and other stored big data infrastructure such as Hadoop and NoSQL databases with solutions that can ingest, correlate and analyze streaming Big Data as well to produce continuous, real-time operational intelligence.”

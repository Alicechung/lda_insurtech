EHRs, health IT can be leveraged to cut health disparities

April 23, 2014

By Jennifer Bresnick
April 23, 2014 - EHR adoption is not a goal in and of itself, but a pathway towards reducing historical health disparities, write Dominick Mack, MD, MBA, Executive Medical Director of the GA-HIT Extension Center and Ayanna V. Buckner, MD, MPH, FACPM, Associate Professor in the Department of Community Health and Preventive Medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine, in a blog post on HealthITBuzz.  As a tool for population health management, EHRs have the potential to close the health gap between those of lower socioeconomic status, who are often affected by chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma, and obesity, and more traditionally affluent populations.
“For communities that have historically experienced disparities in care, the uptake of EHRs and other forms of health IT is good news – as long as the providers and patients in these communities have accessibility to the technology,” write Mack and Buckner. “This means the technology must be available, affordable and sustainable. Health IT that is successfully integrated into clinical workflow has the potential to improve patient safety and quality of care while helping to eliminate health disparities.”
Citing a study that showed that Hispanic and Black patients who received care from EHR-enabled providers with clinical decision support tools had better control of their blood pressure, the authors note that uninsured patients or Medicaid recipients were significantly less likely to engage with patient portals and access primary care on a regular basis than others.  Other studies have shown that nonwhite patients are 33% more likely to die after heart surgery, and that low-income patients are much less satisfied with the quality of their care than those in a higher socioeconomic bracket.
“The diffusion of health care innovations to underserved communities has historically lagged behind white communities,” the authors add. “This disparity is significant as morbidity and mortality rates associated with many chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and HIV/AIDS, are more prevalent among underserved communities of color.”

Providers can leverage HIT infrastructure to track population health, target interventions to high risk patients, and improve emergency preparedness and response.  When providers serving patients displaced by disasters continue to have access to their health information regardless of location, they have a better chance of making better decisions that may save lives. “It is important that national HIT initiatives are effective in assuring that certified EHR and other innovative HIT tools are disseminated fairly to primary care providers who treat underserved populations for the improvement of patient engagement and clinical outcomes to help eliminate health disparities,” the post concludes.

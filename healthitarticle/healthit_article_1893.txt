August 14, 2014 - A population health management and clinical analytics program within the Wyoming Department of Health has reduced Medicaid emergency department visits by 20% and cut 30-day readmissions by .5% since 2012.  Emergency department costs for Medicaid patients were also cut by 20% per patient per month.
By identifying patients who frequently use the emergency room for primary care services and offering them alternate resources, clinicians were able to channel patients to appropriate care while reducing strain on high-cost care locations.  “Our priority is to help people make informed decisions about their healthcare, like how to best manage chronic conditions and where to seek treatment when necessary,” said Dr. James F. Bush, Medical Director of the Wyoming Department of Health.
“Wyoming’s commitment to a consumer-friendly program that improves health outcomes for its Medicaid recipients fits perfectly with Xerox’s vision to use health IT and data analytics to empower patients to take an active role in caring for their health,” said David Hamilton, Group President of Government Healthcare Solutions at Xerox, which provides the analytics solution used by the Department of Health. “We’re providing advice and support that help members make decisions for a healthy lifestyle. By ensuring they receive healthcare in the setting best suited to their level of need, we’re also helping the state reduce Medicaid costs.”

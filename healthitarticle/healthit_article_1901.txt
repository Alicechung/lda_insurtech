August 08, 2014 - Medication management tools, including computerized physician order entry (CPOE), medication analytics, and adverse drug event surveillance software, will be worth more than $1.624 billion by the year 2019, predicts a MarketsandMarkets report.  The global market is set to explode due to the rapidly increasing number of senior citizens as well as an increased focus on reducing medication errors and raising the quality of care in the hospital setting.
Increasing investments in countries such as China and South Korea, as well as federal quality care initiatives in the United States, will push the market upward at a compound annual growth rate of between 13 percent and 15 percent.   North America currently accounts for more than 60% of the $845 million market in 2014.
While the report calls the medication management market “fragmented,” it is currently being led by companies such as CareFusion, McKesson, and Allscripts.  Cerner and Siemens are also leaders in the medication management field, and their combination will go some way towards reducing fragmentation in the arena.

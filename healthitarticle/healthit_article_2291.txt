Flow of data through HIEs is critical for analytics success

September 03, 2013

September 03, 2013 - No man is an island, wrote John Donne, and no health system can think of themselves as isolated anymore if they want to succeed in the new era of healthcare reform.  Health information exchange (HIE) is becoming increasingly vital to hospitals as accountable care makes every provider responsible for what all their partners are doing.  Shared risk and shared success depends on shared information – and having the tools to collect, analyze, and act on that information quickly and effectively.
“Health information exchanges are beginning to do something that hasn’t been possible in the past; they are able to break down the silos of information, presenting aggregated patient views with rich clinical content,” explained Sandlot Solutions CEO Joe Casper to the Institute for Health Technology Transformation.  “Value is derived when more and better information is shared across stakeholders to improve the coordination of care. Further, when the data can be leveraged to create patient engagement, when the exchange can support new business models that manage risk, then stakeholders will see true value.”
Whether analytics programs focus on predicting risk or managing existing business and clinical conditions, good data is the foundation of good information, says Rodney Hamilton, MD, Chief Medial Information Officer at Informatics Corporation of America.  “Because of the sporadic and ad-hoc nature of how IT slowly worked its way into healthcare over several decades, clinical data has been input, displayed and analyzed by countless clinical systems that have no, or very little, alignment with one another.  Healthcare is looking for tools to help get its arms around this volume of data to reorganize, re-interpret and re-align it for use by multiple stakeholders across multiple institutions and regions.”
As state and regional HIEs work to standardize data from their end, as it’s collected from EHRs and transmitted through their infrastructures, health information management professionals are making sense of that data on the receiving end.  The use of continuity of care documents (CCDs) as a basic standard for HIE has helped to turn fragmented, scattered, incomplete data into something analytics professionals can work with.  By aggregating and “normalizing” this data, clinical data repositories can become an effective way to sort and view information.  “These capabilities and tools form the basis for the access, synthesis and use of structured and unstructured data that will take the exchange of clinical information to the next level,” Hamilton predicts.

HIE and analytics will continue to blend in scope and purpose as data exchange becomes ever more important to providing quality care.  HIE and analytics are both interested in providing better workflows, better clinical decision support, and better information to physicians as they complete their daily tasks while providing business intelligence on a broader scale by giving organizations everything they need to know about a patient population.
“The blending of HIE and analytics is the inevitable next step on the path toward the seamless exchange of clinical information,” Hamilton concludes.  “The power of these technologies together provides a solution that can extract, translate and synthesize that data to turn it into usable clinical information giving physicians and providers the information they need when they need it to improve patient outcomes and reduce costs.”

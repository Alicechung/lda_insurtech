November 21, 2014 - Humana Medicare Advantage members in Tennessee who receive services at Summit Medical Group will now be covered under a new accountable care organization (ACO), the organizations announced this week.  Starting January 1, 2015, the seven-year agreement between Humana and the Eastern Tennessee provider with more than 200 physicians and 53 care sites will enhance care coordination and reduce costs by leveraging a pay-for-performance reimbursement structure.
“As a Medicare enrollee’s needs become more complex, the number of needed services and service providers increases,” said Tim Young, Summit Medical Group Chief Executive Officer. “This is when Summit’s Care Coordination staff can intervene and act as the facilitator for the patient, family and the physician, ultimately increasing quality of life and containing costs associated with aging.”
“Summit’s vision for coordinated care and a better patient experience is so closely aligned with our own, it makes them a perfect partner to create a better care delivery system for Medicare members in East Tennessee,” added Doug Haaland, Humana’s Regional President for Senior Markets in Tennessee. “These kinds of partnerships are changing the nature of care delivery and reimbursement, and they’re how we’re going to create a health system that closes the gap between health and care.”
Humana is a key player in the accountable care landscape with more than 1.2 million members and 900 ACOs nationwide.  Recent reports have predicted that accountable care will cover 130 million patients by the year 2017.

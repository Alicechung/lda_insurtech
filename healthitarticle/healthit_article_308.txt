October 31, 2017 - Nine academic institutions and research labs have received a five-year, $25 million grant from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science to develop a national health data analytics and informatics center aimed at coordinated research activities across the country.
The National Center for Data to Health (CD2H) will help to bring together the activities of more than 50 research institutions participating in the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program, providing infrastructure support and collaboration resources to enhance the informatics, translational research, and big data analytics ecosystem.
“The goal is to unlock the amazing wealth of technologies and innovation located within each individual CTSA and to create cohesive communities of practice founded on the fundamental premise that team science, data sharing and collaborative innovation can advance patient care,” said Melissa Haendel from Oregon Health & Science University, who will lead the program.

Other participants include Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Northwestern University, the University of Washington, non-profit Sage Bionetworks, the Scripps Research Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Iowa and the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine.
 “All CTSA hubs have shared an aspiration for federated analyses of clinical data across the network, married with public repositories of basic science data, to achieve unprecedented levels of biomedical knowledge discovery and improved practice,” said Christopher Chute, MD, DrPH, MPH, from Johns Hopkins.
“CD2H will catalyze this process and coordinate the myriad of social, legal and technical requirements to make this practical.”

New Accountable Care Group to Challenge Wisconsin Landscape

December 10, 2014

December 10, 2014 - Two competing accountable care networks are taking shape in Wisconsin to promote integrated healthcare delivery and lower costs for the region’s patients.  While the seven-member abouthealth group grabbed headlines earlier this month, it will face some stiff competition from Integrated Health Network of Wisconsin, which just announced the addition of two new partners.
The Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel reports that Integrated Health Network (IHN) has enlisted Hospital Sisters Health System and Prevea Health to join Froedtert Health, Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare, Columbia St. Mary’s and the Medical College of Wisconsin in its corner.  IHN plans to leverage large-scale EHR data analytics to help its members achieve better care coordination, higher quality, and fewer avoidable costs.
“IHN has the infrastructure in place for its members to truly collaborate on improving quality and efficiency,” Therese Pandl, president and chief executive officer of Hospital Sisters Health System’s Eastern Wisconsin Division, said in a statement. “We are impressed by IHN’s care model, data analytics and quality measures, and by the active involvement of doctors in changing their day-to-day practices.”
Both organizations hope to negotiate contracts with payers that will eventually reward value through pay-for-performance reimbursements.  Population health and chronic disease management will surely be a focus for each group as they battle to lure providers with shared savings and collaborative opportunities to engage in analytics and data exchange.

December 27, 2013 - Patients with pre-diabetes receive less than adequate follow-up care and treatment, according to a retrospective study published this month in Diabetes Care.  The survey of more than 350,000 patients from a large healthcare system found that few pre-diabetics received proactive metformin treatment to control the disease.
Only 18% of patients identified as pre-diabetic during the study had their blood glucose retested after six months.  Thirteen percent had been diagonesed as pre-diabetic by a physician, and 31% had diabetic issues specificed in their EHR notes.  Less than 0.1% of patients were started on a metformin regimen.
“In general, those patients with the highest immediate risk of progression to diabetes were somewhat more likely to receive follow up,” the study authors wrote. “However, despite evidence from the Diabetes Prevention Program that metformin use in prediabetes patients may slow progression to diabetes, metformin use was low, and did not increase among those at highest risk.”

Can mHealth help low-income patients with chronic diseases?

November 12, 2013

By Jennifer Bresnick
November 12, 2013 - From the provider’s perspective, population health management often depends on using a wide swath of data to identify patient cohorts that might benefit from a certain intervention.  But sometimes those cohorts are self-selecting, and offer themselves up as an opportunity for providers to fill a critical need.  Mobile health (mHealth) is becoming an increasingly valuable weapon in the battle against common chronic conditions, and a new report by the Commonwealth Fund shows that it could be more effective than previously imagined among minority and low-income patients suffering from these diseases.
While the number of commercially available apps for Apple and Android phones is staggering, and many of these apps provide only questionable medical value, payers and hospital systems are also investing in tailored mHealth technology, developed with input from clinicians and intended to fill specific needs.  Clinical management apps range from mobile patient portals to secure texting with providers to reference materials, and can be a vital bridge between safety net populations and providers when access to routine care is prohibitively difficult or expensive.
The Commonwealth Fund report found that in 2010, African American and Hispanic patients were more likely than white patients to own a smartphone, and more likely to use that phone to access health information.  As minority populations are also disproportionately affected by chronic conditions like diabetes and asthma, this presents a clear opportunity for providers to proactively engage with patients through mHealth to improve everyday care and preventative disease management.
Geisinger Health System, for example, developed an app to survey patients with persistent asthma every 90 days.  Patients with low asthma management scores receive a call from a nurse to help them manage the condition and schedule appointments if necessary.   A different asthma app, developed by Asthmapolis and backed by the California HealthCare Foundation, found that tacking Bluetooth sensors onto rescue inhalers can track usage and provide personalized feedback to reduce instances of uncontrolled asthma by 50 percent.

Barriers to the widespread adoption of mHealth as an integrated piece of the population health management puzzle remain, however.  Few providers have started to receive financial reimbursements for the use of such techniques, and accessing quality tools continues to be a challenge for the majority of patients.  While the FDA recently released its final guidance on the regulation of mHealth, which may aid in the development of clinically relevant applications, peer-reviewed evidence of the effectiveness of such tools is still scare.
As smartphones become ever more integral to the daily lives of patients in all socioeconomic brackets, the use of mHealth is predicted to rise steadily.  With the market’s expansion comes the chance for providers to leverage the growing interest in mHealth use among vulnerable populations with the intention of preventing unnecessary emergency room visits and hospitalizations down the line.  mHealth adoption may be aided by the shift to accountable care and value-based payments, producing a compelling business case for the growth of chronic disease management applications available wherever a patient happens to be.

Clinical documentation improvement isn’t just for ICD-10

December 30, 2013

By Jennifer Bresnick
December 30, 2013 - The ICD-10 transition is putting the spotlight on data integrity like never before.  Providers worried about meeting the higher standards of detail and specificity in clinical documentation for the October 1, 2014 transition have been scrambling to train their physicians to write more complete notes packed with as much information as possible.
But ICD-10 isn’t the only reason why clinical documentation needs to be better.  Analytics goals such as population health management, risk stratification, and financial efficiency also rely on a foundation of clear, precise, and detailed clinical data in order to produce meaningful insights.
One of the positive side effects of the generally onerous code switch is this focus on improving data integrity at its source: the EHR buttons, drop-downs, and text fields that capture information straight from the patient’s mouth and the physician’s fingers.  While the transition requires a great deal of coordination among multiple initiatives all aimed at preparing healthcare organizations for a major shift in coding and billing, clinical documentation improvement (CDI) is still top of the list for many providers.  But despite the growing awareness that ICD-10 is going to affect every workflow process from start to finish, many physicians still haven’t made the necessary changes to their daily habits.
“I’ve been doing CDI for 15 years and physicians still don’t provide all the details needed to ensure appropriate, thorough documentation,” says Mel Tully, MSN, CCDS, CDIP and Vice President of Clinical Services and Education at Nuance.  “Unless they’re being prompted and given a tool or person to help guide them, they will always document pneumonia as pneumonia.  There are many, many other ways to document it and even today, physicians still need guidance on how best to capture the specific details needed to accurately reflect the severity of the care provided.”

Recent industry surveys have found that CDI is top of mind for at least 73% of providers during their ICD-10 testing process, with 40% planning to break out documentation improvement into its own separate effort.  Nearly a quarter of providers are more focused on CDI than testing the technical ability of their claims to transmit to business partners, which shows that a lack of good documentation is nagging at the thoughts of a significant number of organizations.
“You’ve got to have the right type of data, the right amount of it, and you’ve got to be able to trust the validity of that data – or you can’t trust the results from analyzing it,” says Shane Pilcher, Vice President at Stoltenberg Consulting.  “The majority of hospitals are falling short of the data that they need right now.”  CDI programs intended to ease the ICD-10 transition will leave providers with a better understanding of what data is necessary and how to capture it, leaving them with stronger data assets once the waves caused by the transition settle down.
“[Providers] that are looking at this longer term, and looking at what advantage they’re going to derive from it, are using the transition to ICD-10 as a time to do some other things that they know they need to do,” explains Linda Kloss, RHIA, former CEO of AHIMA, founder of Kloss Strategic Advisors, and a member of the Precyse Advisory Council.  “I think it’s an opportunity to put in place some of the checks and balances that are needed for all of our data processes.  We can be a little savvier about this by stepping back and treating this as a competency that healthcare organizations need to have.”
Treating CDI as a larger push towards the data integrity necessary for clinical analytics can help bring value to the effort that will echo far beyond ICD-10.  “So much of the frenzy has been about getting to the October 1 start date, and getting through the implementation itself,” Kloss adds.  “I’m not underestimating the cost and complexity of it, but it’s also time to start turning our attention to life after October 1, and how we’re going to use that data.”

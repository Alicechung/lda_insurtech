Multidisciplinary statisticians will further healthcare big data

September 10, 2014

By Jennifer Bresnick
September 10, 2014 - A multidisciplinary approach with an emphasis on statistics and scientific thinking will be critical for harnessing and leveraging big data in healthcare, says a new white paper from the American Statistical Association.  Approaching complicated and noisy clinical datasets with a mathematical mind can help to bolster decision-making processes while refining new technologies and machine learning applications to zero in on key insights.
“Data touch almost every aspect of our lives, from the way we transact commerce on the web, to how we measure our fitness and safety, to the way doctors treat our illnesses, to economic decisions that affect entire nations,” the paper says. “The age of Big Data will be a golden era for statistics. Scientific fields are transitioning from data-poor to data-rich and—across industries, science, and government—methods for making decisions are becoming more data-driven as large amounts of data are being harvested and stored.”
“Because one can easily be fooled by complicated biases and patterns arising by chance, and because statistics has matured around making discoveries from data, statistical thinking will be integral to Big Data challenges,” the brief adds.
As healthcare shifts into a data-centric industry and the sheer volume of available data multiplies at an exponential rate, data scientists and technology developers will need to discover more efficient ways of collecting, storing, categorizing, and presenting data sets.  The white paper identifies four key areas that healthcare data scientists will need to address to accomplish the objectives of population health management and personalized clinical care: causal inference, bias reduction, pattern mining, and model tradeoffs.

Since the data used for most population health management and clinical decision support applications is observational in nature, healthcare organizations must be careful to understand “the true causal impact and comparative effectiveness of treatments or care in terms of outcomes, satisfaction, and cost may involve the analysis of electronic medical records, claims databases, and quality surveys from thousands, and eventually, millions of people,” the paper says.  Big data analytics is further complicated by the natural bias inherent in population data, which may contain gaps in relation to crucial sub-populations, and the need to balance competing goals such as interpretability and accuracy.
Statisticians have long been engaged in combating these challenges in the public health field as well as in a number of other industries, such as finance, business, the social sciences, and engineering.  As leaders of interdisciplinary data sciences teams, they can provide an important body of knowledge for developing predicting analytics algorithms, studying increasingly large and complex population data sets, and developing visualization applications for bringing analytical insights to providers and other end users.
“The history of statistics shows how statisticians have engaged in interdisciplinary research, and how that engagement advanced domain sciences, informed policy, and provided new insights,” the brief concludes.  “Multidisciplinary teams—with each discipline having much to learn from other disciplines—will ensure the best science is brought to bear, help to avoid reinvention of existing techniques from the contributing data science disciplines, and spur development of new theories and approaches.”

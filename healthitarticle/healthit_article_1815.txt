October 03, 2014 - The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is expanding a health information exchange program with Walgreens, allowing the retail pharmacy chain to provide immunizations to veterans in order to improve access to flu shots and other recommended vaccines.  As part of its focus on improving its health data infrastructure, the VA will now be able to connect to the pharmacy chain’s cloud-based EHR system and record patient data in its own VistA medical records.
“VA is proud to partner with Walgreens to provide needed vaccines to our nation’s Veterans,” said VA Secretary Robert A. McDonald. “This partnership is a great example of how government and the private sector can work together to effectively and efficiently provide Veterans the care and benefits that they’ve earned.”
“The VA-Walgreens partnership gives Veterans greater choice in time and location for getting their flu shots without having to complete any other VA forms,” added Interim Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Carolyn Clancy. “With this program, the Veteran patient’s record is integrated, and VA maintains a complete immunization record that allows us to more effectively provide patient-centered care.”
The program will only fund approximately 75,000 flu shots at 8,200 Walgreens locations, subject to availability and insurance coverage, the press release noted.

December 11, 2014 - KLAS Research’s second annual rankings of population health management software vendors show just how quickly the market for such analytics and patient stratification technologies is evolving.  After implementing EHR systems and looking over the horizon at the next steps in healthcare reform, providers are seeking population health help from vendors and developers in this expanding field.
In the report, seventy percent of providers surveyed about their population health infrastructure said that they see tangible benefits to patient care, especially in the areas of improved outcomes, cost savings, and better prevention and care planning.
“Providers are starting to recognize the tangible benefits of population health efforts,” said report author Mark Allphin. “With all of the focus on this segment, providers are asking which vendors are best positioned to help them realize those benefits. This report was an effort to answer that question.”
KLAS interviewed more than 200 providers at 173 organizations to gather data on the performance and impact of twenty-eight population health management vendors.  The report ranked Phytel as the highest performer in the space with an overall score of 89.8 out of 100.  Forward Health Group received a score of 87.2 from the surveyed providers.  Other vendors mentioned in the report include Allscripts, athenahealth, Caradigm, Health Catalyst, McKesson, NextGen, and Verisk Health.

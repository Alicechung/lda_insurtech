Study: More drugs might not mean fewer blood clots

September 04, 2014 - An increase in the number of drug-based interventions may not reduce the risk of blood clots for hospitalized patients, according to a new study from the University of Michigan.  The report, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, casts doubt on the effectiveness of strategies to broaden pharmacologic prophylaxis as a defense against venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the general population.
Researchers examined clinical data from more than 20,000 patients at 35 different Michigan hospitals.  After 90 days of follow-up, the rate of VTE was low at 1.1 percent, and the number of VTEs diagnosed in the hospital was even smaller, at just 0.16 percent.  Most of the hospital-associated VTEs were discovered post-discharge.  Of the patients who developed a VTE within 90 days of a hospital admission more than 70% had received pharmacologic prophylaxis.  However, hospitals that delivered higher rates of drug-based intervention did not have lower risk-adjusted rates of VTE compared with hospitals that were more sparing with the medications.
“Numerous quality improvement efforts have focused on increasing the use of preventative medications to reduce blood clots and subsequent complications among hospitalized patients but we did not find evidence that these efforts actually reduce risks,” says lead author Scott Flanders, MD, MHM, professor of internal medicine and director of hospital medicine at the U-M Medical School. “Our findings imply that efforts to broadly increase rates of drug interventions in non-ICU medical patients may not result in meaningful outcomes.”

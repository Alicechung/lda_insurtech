September 16, 2014 - In a bid to expand its healthcare footprint, Cognizant Technology Solutions, an outsourcing and consulting firm, has agreed to buy healthcare analytics company TriZetto for $2.7 billion.  Together, the new $3 billion healthcare operation will serve the technology needs of 350 health plans and 245,000 providers who oversee the care of 180 million patients.
“Healthcare is undergoing structural shifts due to reform, cost pressure and shifting responsibilities between payers and providers. This creates a significant growth opportunity, which TriZetto will help us capture,” said Francisco D’Souza, CEO of Cognizant. “We are excited that the integrated portfolio of capabilities across technology and operations will uniquely position us to help clients drive higher levels of operational efficiency, while re-imagining care for the future. We look forward to welcoming the TriZetto team into the Cognizant family and creating a truly differentiated and sustainable foundation for healthcare.”
“The combination of TriZetto with Cognizant will bring a whole new level of capability to the market,” added R. Andrew Eckert, CEO of TriZetto. “I’m excited about what this means to both companies as well as the markets and clients that we serve.”

EHR Data Integrity Not Robust Enough for Clinical Trial Use

July 19, 2016

By Sara Heath
July 19, 2016 - EHR data is not strong enough to support research and clinical trials, says the American Medical Informatics Association.
In a letter commenting on the FDA’s draft guidance on the use of EHR data in clinical trials and research, AMIA says that researchers and industry professionals should not rely on electronic health records for accurate, complete, and meaningful information when conducting medical research and clinical trials.  
“We strongly caution FDA from assuming that most EHRs are readily configurable for clinical investigations, even among more advanced institutions,” wrote the organization’s president, Douglas B. Fridsma, MD, PhD, FACP, FACMI, and board chair, Thomas H. Payne, MD, FACP, FACMI.
The FDA has overemphasized the use of EHR data in the research setting, the pair said, assuming that the technology is able to collect accurate data that is up to the standard necessary for quality clinical research. However, there are several reasons why EHRs may not be the best path forward for research.

“Specifically, we perceive an over-reliance on the assurances resulting from ONC’s Health IT Certification Program related to data reliability and interoperability,” Fridsma and Payne wrote.
“Further, we discuss ways FDA could improve the likelihood of data integrity when using EHR source data and we raise a number of additional issues for FDA to consider when finalizing this guidance.”
These issues are ultimately rooted in the fact that the EHR’s central purpose is to advance the care of patients in a clinical setting, not to serve as data repositories for investigative projects.
“Ensuring data integrity and tracking data provenance in clinical settings is incredibly complicated because multiple, authorized individuals contribute to the EHR and the specificity of audit logs varies widely,” AMIA commented.
“If the FDA is interested in which data populated the electronic data capture (EDC) system or electronic case reporting form (eCRF) and where they originated along the continuum of care, the answer could prove extremely difficult and burdensome.”
Further, the organization says FDA overestimates the effectiveness of ONC’s Health IT Certification Program. This is potentially problematic because certified EHR technology does not necessarily equate to high quality health data.
“ONC’s Health IT Certification Program is not designed to ensure data ‘reliability’ or integrity,” Fridsma and Payne explained. “Indeed, such integrity and reliability is generally the result of the policies, procedures and actions of the EHR users rather than the technology itself, and we see this guidance overstating the ability of certification to deliver clinical investigation-quality data as a byproduct of care delivery.”
To account for the potentially lacking data integrity, AMIA recommends that the FDA explore the use of data warehouses. These warehouses use data standards that could make research data more usable and interoperable for the purpose of a clinical investigation.
Going forward, AMIA recommends that the FDA should work with ONC to determine appropriate health IT certifications, and to specify the ways in which CEHRT could be reliable enough to improve clinical trial data.
In spite of these two issues, AMIA generally praised FDA’s efforts to boost EHR data usage in clinical research, saying that it  marks a path forward for health IT. Because health IT is so ubiquitous across the industry, Fridsma and Payne said, it is important that leaders begin to acknowledge its peripheral uses.
“With more than 96 percent of US hospitals and 83 percent of US office-based physicians using EHRs to deliver clinical care, we have an unprecedented opportunity to utilize digitized healthcare data for supplemental uses, such as clinical investigations, especially for prospective controlled clinical trials,” they wrote.
“We believe this guidance is well-timed and can serve as a valuable signal to industry, and other stakeholders, on how to orient technical functionalities and organizational policies to capitalize on this opportunity.”
Going forward, however, the agency will need to reconsider how to ensure the highest quality of data coming from the EHR, helping to produce the most effective and precise results in a clinical investigation.

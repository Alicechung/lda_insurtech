August 20, 2014 - Registration for the 2014 Million Hearts Challenge is now underway, according to an announcement in the Federal REgister, and is aiming to improve hypertension control for ten million Americans by 2017, hopefully resulting in at least one million fewer strokes.
“Million Hearts is working to control high blood pressure through clinical approaches, such as using health information technology to its fullest potential and integrating team-based approaches to care, as well as community approaches, such as strengthening tobacco control, and lowering sodium consumption,” the notice says.
“The challenge will bring prestige to organizations that invest in hypertension control, improve understanding of successful implementation strategies at the health system level, and motivate practices and health systems to strengthen their hypertension control efforts.”
The program will highlight the efforts of clinicians and provider organizations that have exceptional rates of hypertension control, and will award cash prizes to the winners.  Providers can register for the challenge through October 10, 2014 by visiting the Million Hearts website.

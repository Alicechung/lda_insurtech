June 12, 2014 - Humana and the UC San Diego Health System have entered an accountable care agreement to focus on improving outcomes and lowering costs for Southern California patients.  The only academic medical system in the region, UCSD consists of two major hospital centers, a cancer hospital, cardiovascular care center, and twenty-two outpatient clinics.
“This Accountable Care partnership with UC San Diego Health System is a natural fit for Humana, as we already share a focus on integrated health and patient-centered care,” said Jim Brown, President of Humana’s Senior Products in California. Humana currently engages in more than 900 accountable care relationships with 33,000 physicians across 40 states. “We believe our Medicare Advantage members in Greater San Diego will greatly benefit from this agreement, helping them maintain their health and well-being.”
The partnership will help to foster care coordination with the aid of clinical analytics and population health management tools in order to manage chronic diseases and promote wellness.  The agreement also brings value-based incentives to UCSD providers in an effort to cut costs through care coordination and performance improvement.

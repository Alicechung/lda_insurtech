July 11, 2014 - The Health Care Cost Institute (HCCI) has been named the first Qualified Entity (QE) allowed full access to national Medicare claims data, allowing the independent, non-profit organization to track and publicly report on population health trends as well as the price and quality of healthcare services.
“The national Medicare cost data set will be a powerful addition to the HCCI transparency initiative, providing essential information to help us better understand what is needed to improve the quality and performance of the U.S. health system,” said David Newman, executive director of HCCI. “Public reporting, as permitted with these data, when combined with cost and quality data from commercial health plans and state Medicaid data will represent the most credible information source for consumers, regulators and employers on health care cost and quality variation.”
The QE agreement will allow HCCI to access 100% of traditional Medicare claims data and 40% of Medicare Part D prescription drug data.  The organization currently has access to 40% of Medicare Part C population information already.
With the new data, HCCI plans to develop an information portal that will allow consumers, employers, and regulators the ability to access data on the price and quality of services, including data from major insurers such as Humana, UnitedHealthcare, and Aetna to bolster its pricing analytics.  Other payer partners will be announced soon, the press release says, and the portal will be launched in early 2015.

EHNAC, DirectTrust to Accredit Personal Health Records, Portals

April 10, 2015 - The Electronic Healthcare Network Accreditation Commission (EHNAC) and DirectTrust, originator of the Direct secure messaging protocol, are teaming up to provide industry standards for vendors of personal health records and patient portal products.  The accreditation program follows several other recent EHNAC efforts to increase consumer trust and ensure the delivery of high-quality health IT products and services, from practice management packages to health information exchanges.
“Personal health records and patient portal vendors are the fastest growing new membership group within DirectTrust – and they deserve a rigorous accreditation program that recognizes the same level of data security and privacy as other organizations accredited by EHNAC-DirectTrust,” said DirectTrust President and CEO David C. Kibbe, MD. “The program that DirectTrust and EHNAC is piloting will provide assurance equivalent to and possibly beyond what HIPAA requires. For example, we’re looking into incorporating an encryption component for stored data, as well as two-factor authentication to further protect the customers of both PHR vendors and EHR vendors looking to develop their own portals.”
“We’re in an environment of increased angst over security and privacy issues – and with good reason,” added Lee Barrett, EHNAC Executive Director. “Today’s healthcare providers not only have access to a patient’s protected health information including financial data, but also insights into diagnoses, treatment plans, medications, etc. As patients take greater control over their own healthcare decisions and transition their health information to personal health records, they need to have confidence in all healthcare stakeholders that their data will remain secure and confidential. EHNAC and DirectTrust are working collaboratively to close that gap.”

July 01, 2014 - The University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) and University of California San Francisco (UCSF) have received $10 million in grants from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to create a web-based model of care for dementia patients and their families.  By incorporating mHealth monitoring with smartphones and sensors, online education, and constant access to provider consults, the system will help patients and their families keep in contact with clinicians and meet the challenges of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and other dementia conditions.
Beginning in the fall of 2014, 2100 patients with varying stage of dementia will be enrolled in the pilot.  Each patient will be assigned a navigator who will coordinate by telephone, have access to a clinical data dashboard, and triage calls to ensure appropriate access to providers or answer questions on their own.  A portion of the patients will also receive home monitors, wristband trackers, and smartphone apps to help record data, monitor movement, and detect behavioral changes that may signal a decline in health.
The pilot is projected to save $4.3 million over its three-year lifespan by improvement medication management, reducing emergency room visits by half, cutting hospitalizations by a third, and allowing patients to live in their own homes for longer without the need of long-term care facilities or nursing homes.

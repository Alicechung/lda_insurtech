December 03, 2014 - A group of seven Wisconsin hospitals and health systems have formed a strategic partnership focused on providing accountable care and improved population health management to the nearly 90% of patients in the state that fall under their purview.  The members of the abouthealth network operate on the same EHR platform, which will encourage health information exchange and care coordination throughout the 47 hospitals and 7,000 providers included in the collaboration
“Collaboration is at the root of the abouthealth partnership,” said Greg Devine, the CEO of abouthealth. “We’re like-minded health care organizations partnering to make health care more accessible, approachable and easy for consumers at all stages of life.”
“At the end of the day, each of the partners is ‘about health’ for our patients and the communities we serve. We believe that through clinical integration we can do something special in Wisconsin and make abouthealth the model for the future.”
The seven healthcare systems involved in the partnership are: Aspirus, Aurora Health Care, Bellin Health, Gundersen Health System, ProHealth Care, ThedaCare, and UW Health.

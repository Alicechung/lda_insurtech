Fearing a scolding, 50% of patients lie about their health

October 02, 2014

By Jennifer Bresnick
October 02, 2014 - Half of patients admit to lying, minimizing, or evading when asked about symptoms or lifestyle habits that may influence their outcomes, according to new research from Software Advice, mostly because they are afraid of being lectured or judged by their physicians.  Drug and alcohol use, diet, and current medications are among the most common fibs and omissions, according to the survey, but patients who receive encouragement and assurances of confidentiality are less likely to sweep the truth under the rug.
Physicians can’t make appropriate clinical decisions and provide optimal care if they don’t have a complete and accurate patient history at their disposal, but coaxing information about sensitive behaviors out of wary or embarrassed patients is no easy task.  Out of more than 3,000 patients, a quarter responded that they “rarely” deceive their physician, while 6% admitted that they always obscure the truth to some degree.
Unsurprisingly, drug and alcohol use was the most common information that patients wanted to withhold, followed by diet and sexual activity.  Fifteen percent of patients lied about something even more serious: the current medications they are taking, which could have significant implications for the way physicians prescribe other drugs or treatments.
Patients most often minimized their behaviors, including downplaying the number of drinks they have per week or dismissing the impact of a certain symptom or behavior.  Only a little more than ten percent of patients admit to outright fabrications, but more than a quarter withhold information, refuse to discuss a topic, or lie by omission.

Most of the time patients are simply afraid of how their physicians will react.  The survey participants said that they are most likely to lie in order to avoid a lecture or the embarrassment of revealing their circumstances, while more than 10% keep data to themselves in the interest of protecting their privacy.  Almost one in ten patients has lied in order to avoid the costs of a treatment or the inconvenience of taking action to improve their care.
Physicians can avoid uncomfortable, unproductive conversations by changing their own behaviors in order to encourage openness in the consult room.  Being aware of judgmental preconceptions – and the expression of non-acceptance through negative body language or word choice – can help patients feel more willing to share their information.
Nearly a quarter of patients would respond to an assurance of non-judgment from their provider, while 35% would be more willing to share if they were educated about the confidentiality of their revelations.  Nineteen percent would be most convinced by an explanation of the implications of misinforming caregivers, which could include misdiagnosis and harmful medication interactions.

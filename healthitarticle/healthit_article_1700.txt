December 11, 2014 - Local hospital quality planning and improvement efforts are strongly influenced by the measures reported on the Medicare Hospital Compare website, according to a new survey published in JAMA Internal Medicine. The survey indicates that more than 70 percent of hospitals confirmed that public reporting stimulated quality improvement activity in their institution.
A total of 87.1 percent of hospitals also reported incorporating performance on publicly reported measures into their hospital’s annual goals.  An additional 89.7 percent of hospitals reported believing that their hospital’s reputation was influenced by patient experience measures.
Seventy-four percent of participants believed that mortality rates played a major role in a hospital’s perceived reputation(), followed closely  by process measures at 76.3 percent, re-admission at 69.9 percent, 66.1 percent for cost measures and 54 percent for volume.
Respondents who identified themselves as chief quality officers or vice presidents of quality were less likely to agree that public reporting stimulates quality improvement, and concerns were expressed about the clinical meaningfulness of public reporting.

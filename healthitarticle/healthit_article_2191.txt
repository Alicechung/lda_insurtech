November 19, 2013 - Two North Carolina health systems, Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center and Cornerstone Health Care, are partnering to increase their strategic ability to improve their services through accountable care.  By using population health management techniques and data analytics, the neighboring facilities will attempt to cut costs and boost quality while delivering value-driven patient-centered care.
“It is crucial in this challenging health care environment for multiple health care providers to join together and assume accountability for managing and improving health care,” said John D. McConnell, MD, CEO of Wake Forest. “Through better care coordination, we plan to provide more integrated care with fewer duplicated services, increased patient access to support services, and lower total health care costs.”
“This is the first-of-its-kind Triad partnership between an academic medical center and an independent, multi-specialty provider group,” added Grace Terrell, MD, CEO at Cornerstone Health Care. “Our joint goal is to enhance the quality of patient care while decreasing overall health care costs by leveraging each organization’s strengths to accomplish these objectives.”
While Wake Forest is still attempting to recover from serious financial issues caused in part by its implementation of its Epic EHR system, the collaboration between the two organizations is a step forward in the fight to trim financial waste and focus on population analytics in order to integrate quality accountable care.

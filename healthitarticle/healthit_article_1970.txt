June 16, 2014 - The University of North Dakota’s State Board of Higher Education is slated to vote on the foundation of a new clinical analytics and disease data mining hub that would bring population health management insights and better patient care to the North Dakota region.  The proposed Center for Comparative Effectiveness Analytics would become the center of research and data collection for providers seeking data-driven evidence for chronic disease management.
The program “basically analyzes that data to help us make better decisions about clinical care and population health care by looking at best practices and whether people are getting the most effective, efficient care,” said Ray Goldsteen, Director of UND’s Master of Public Health program. “This information, once analyzed and data-mined, will help new patients explore a comprehensive list of options according to their quality and cost.”
If the Board approves the program during its June 26 vote, the center will begin operations this fall, Goldsteen said, starting with a pilot program to demonstrate its value before applying for grant funding from organizations like the Agency for Healthcare Quality (AHRQ) or the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) early in 2015.
In addition to providing knowledge to the region’s providers, Goldsteen adds, the program will hopefully grow the university’s prestige in the clinical analytics field. “We’re hoping this program will attract more applicants to our program that would come here that normally may not have applied here,” he said.

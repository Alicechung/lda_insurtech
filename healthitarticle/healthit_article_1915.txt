July 25, 2014 - New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced $55 million in grant funding for a series of projects at the City University of New York (CUNY), $27 million of which will be focused on big data analytics and healthcare workforce developments.  The CUNY 2020 grants aim to increase job opportunities and foster economic stimulation across the 20 campuses in the system, and will offer up to $110 million to continue the efforts over the next few years.
“The CUNY 2020 program is designed to connect the innovative, academic programs offered by New York City’s public universities to local economic development,” Governor Cuomo said. “In today’s economy, universities are not just classrooms and research facilities; they support thousands of local jobs and are often the top economic driver in local communities. With these awards, the State is pleased to provide funding that will help CUNY continue to offer a world-class education to hundreds of thousands of students, while also supporting new jobs and investment in the surrounding communities.”
The Big Data Consortium, a collaboration between the Graduate Center at the College of Staten Island, CUNY School of Professional Studies, Borough of Manhattan Community College, and the NYC College of Technology, City College, will receive $15 million to expand the center’s capacity for data analytics and visualization across the public and private sectors while training graduates in data sciences to combat a predicted shortfall of informatics jobs.
The Allied Health Training for Employment in the Bronx program has received $2 million to update facilities used to train healthcare students for real-life situations, while the Center for Allied Health Education and Workforce Development has been given $10 million to establish a new clinic in Northern Queens that will serve as a training center while addressing the needs of underserved urban populations.  The project expects to add 678 allied healthcare education jobs over the next three years.

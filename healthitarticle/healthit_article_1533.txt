EHNAC Releases Practice Management Accreditation Criteria

March 18, 2015

By Jennifer Bresnick
March 18, 2015 - EHNAC has released its initial practice management accreditation criteria for vendors interested in certifying that their products meet minimum privacy, security, and functionality standards.  The program is designed to promote trust between providers and vendors of software that has become critical for ensuring proper patient flow and revenue cycle management in conjunction with EHRs and other health IT infrastructure.
The Practice Management System Accreditation Program (PMSAP) was developed in partnership with WEDI in order to “[assess] health information and oversight for meeting privacy and security, HIPAA, HITECH, Omnibus Rule and ACA requirements, as well as technical performance, business processes and resource management,” according to EHNAC’s website.
“The program was designed for PMS vendors who provide the necessary software to keep medical offices running smoothly and facilitate everything from practice management and operations to revenue cycle optimization, monthly report generation and the seamless integration with electronic health record systems.”
WEDI has formally endorsed the criteria, calling it a “comprehensive evaluation” in a letter to its members.  “Development of the new program is guided by a formal advisory committee, which represents every major healthcare association, including MGMA, HIMSS and HATA, the newly formed Healthcare Administrative Technology Association,” wrote Devin Jopp, EdD, President and CEO of WEDI. “The voluntary committee also includes executive representatives of some of the biggest PMS vendor names in the industry.”

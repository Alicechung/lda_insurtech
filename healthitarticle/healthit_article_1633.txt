January 21, 2015 - National Coordinator Karen DeSalvo has appointed Dr. Michael James McCoy as the ONC’s first chief health information officer just a few months after CMS established the new Office of Enterprise Data and Analytics.  In his new position, McCoy will expand and enrich the federal government’s focus on health information management, data analytics, and interoperability, said DeSalvo in an email to ONC staff, reprinted below:
Mike is a board certified obstetrician/gynecologist who practiced clinically for more than 20 years, and has over a decade of experience in health information technology, with special interests in interoperability, user experience, and person-centered care.  His background includes leadership roles in nearly all facets of the health IT domain – from use in small physician offices to large national health delivery systems, IT development and standards development organizations.
Mike has been involved with standards development for well over a decade, including Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Patient Care Coordination domain, and the IHE International Board of Directors. He represented the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) as its health information technology strategist in multiple SDO forums; has worked with the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology (CCHIT) as co-chair of the Women’s Health Work Group; and participated on the Child Health Expert Panel and the Ambulatory Work Group.  Mike received his B.S. in biology, magna cum laude, from Georgia State University and his M.D. from the Medical College of Georgia.
The appointment will be effective on January 26, 2015.

WEDI to Examine Data Analytics Backbone of Bundled Payments

April 10, 2015

By Jennifer Bresnick
April 10, 2015 - The Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) has announced the formation of a new committee focused on assessing the data analytics and health information exchange underpinnings of bundled payments and other value-based reimbursement initiatives.
A project team spun out of the Payment Models Workgroup will dig into the health IT infrastructure necessary to support bundled payments and reimbursement based on concrete episodes of care, an increasingly popular structure for payers seeking to control the skyrocketing costs of diseases like cancer while reducing negative variations in care quality.
“As the healthcare industry continues to evolve payment from fee-for-service to fee-for-value, WEDI is taking the initiative to lead industry efforts to ensure that the new models are effectively leveraging technology to make the movement of payment-related data as efficient as possible,” said Devin Jopp, EdD, president and CEO of WEDI. “With the gaining momentum of the bundled payments, WEDI is convening leading healthcare organizations to help develop industry guidance on how to streamline the exchange of clinical and administrative data in these forms of payment models.”
Both private payers and CMS are actively pursuing bundled payments as a cost containment measure, and their experiments have quickly borne fruit.  Last year, UnitedHealthcare revealed that its bundled payment program for oncologists reduced costs by more than a third before quickly expanding enrollment to additional organizations.  CMS followed suit with its new accountable care options for cancer patients, while providers like the Cleveland Clinic’s Heart and Vascular Institute are embracing the bundled payment trend to reduce overutilization of services, standardize treatments, and receive adequate compensation for acute episodes of patient management.

“Bundled pricing is something that patients and care providers want, and this is our first opportunity to better understand how we can manage costs without sacrificing quality care and patient outcomes,” said Thomas W. Feeley, MD, head of Anesthesiology and Critical Care at the MD Anderson Cancer Center and leader of its Institute for Cancer Care Innovation.  MD Anderson joined the UnitedHealthcare bundled payments pilot in December to measure the impact of standardized care paths for certain head and neck cancers.
In an accompanying issue brief, WEDI explains that bundled payments are about more than just controlling costs.  When providers receive payment for a limited number of services, they must be significantly more conscious of care coordination and have an increased financial incentive to deliver preventative care that may preclude more serious conditions that could lead to complications that fall outside of the scope of their bundled payments.
To make the reimbursement scheme truly effective for providers, they must rely on clinical data, health information exchange, predictive analytics, and historical claims data in order to target services appropriately for an individual patient within a given episode, as well as gain insight into the potential needs of the population at large.
The WEDI workgroup will help providers predict their future revenue streams and take full advantage of current accountable care arrangements by developing guidance related to the data analytics and health information exchange capabilities required to participate in this form of population health management.
Its first mission will be to craft and release a white paper entitled “The State of Technology to Support Payment Bundles in 2015,” which will break down the reimbursement landscape and associated health IT requirements by stakeholder type.  The report will include examples of health IT use, information on data standards that must be adopted in order to further industry-wide interoperability, and illustrate how health IT adoption can impact the entire care continuum.

BCBS Illinois, GI specialty group start care coordination pilot

October 15, 2014

By Jennifer Bresnick
October 15, 2014 - Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois has started a care coordination and population health management pilot program with the Illinois Gastroenterology Group (IGG) focusing on managing chronic conditions such as Crohn’s disease.  The first intensive medical home (IMH) program in Illinois provides care management for patients in between visits in order to monitor symptoms and provide support for the most high-risk patients at the largest GI group in the state.
Project Sonar, a care management tool developed by IGG, sends secure communications to patients on a monthly basis which include questions on their health status and symptom intensity.  The answers to the survey are converted into a numerical score that helps providers understand a patient’s overall status at a glance.
“Studies have shown that the rate of complications decreases with improved patient communication,” says IGG physician Lawrence Kosinski, MD, MBA.  “In this project we are using our Secure Patient Portal and Smartphone Technology to create a ‘Sonar System’ which communicates with our patients in an effort to assess how well they are doing in between their face to face visits. The Portal is secure, safe and HIPAA compliant.”
“The IMH is a first step for providers that aren’t able to be part of a larger Accountable Care Organization, but do want to be part of a value-based care model,” adds Walter Hollinger, MD, medical director of strategic operations at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois. “This Specialty IMH arrangement with IGG represents a continuing shift in the evolving nature of how we pay for medical services, and it moves reimbursement away from fee-for-service payments to those that are payments for value.”

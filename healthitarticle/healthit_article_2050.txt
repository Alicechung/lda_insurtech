CMS claims, clinical data team up in new analytics database

March 13, 2014

By Jennifer Bresnick
March 13, 2014 - The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) have announced a new collaboration with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services intended to pool vast amounts of clinical and claims data in a linked database to further research and analytics. By linking short-term data owned by STS and DCRI with the longer view created by historical insurance claims from CMS, researchers hope to take a deeper look at how patients progress over time and manifest risks associated with costly conditions.
“Currently, the STS National Database has clinical data that are all short-term,” explained STS Research Center Director Fred H. Edwards, MD. “The data include patient outcomes in the hospital and, at most, what happens up to 30 days after discharge. This new collaboration with DCRI will enable STS to track long-term patient outcomes and better understand how patients fare years down the road, which will ultimately lead to improved patient care.”
“STS will be able to create more accurate and up-to-date risk models and long-term survival calculators for individual procedures,” added David M. Shahian, MD, Chair of the STS Workforce on National Databases. “Surgeons would be able to estimate survival probability for patients based on their specific illness severity, co-existing medical conditions, and symptoms. This is particularly important for patients as they research treatment options and work with their physician teams to select the care they feel is best.”
The STS National Database was established in 1989, and contains more than 5.5 million patient records from cardiac and general thoracic surgery cases spread over three subcategories.  With the need to assess risk and outcomes for patients with congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and other cardiac conditions taking on a new urgency as the Medicare population booms and healthcare costs continue to skyrocket, this first-of-its-kind collaboration holds promise for the creation of more comprehensive population health management techniques and a better idea of which treatments work and which ones fail.

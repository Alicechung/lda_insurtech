May 20, 2014 - The Alliance for Clinical Research Excellence and Safety (ACRES), a global partnership to improve the safety, quality, and efficiency of clinical research, has announced the development of a new interface to support its open-access network of clinical research sites.  The interface will include an online performance dashboard, risk-based quality management analytics, and cloud-based tools for workflow management and safety monitoring.
“This is an extraordinary accomplishment and opportunity,” noted David Loose, managing partner at Essex Management, an IT consulting firm working on the project. “The ACRES-convened consortium brings together existing, proven technologies to ‘leap-frog’ development and implementation of a much needed information platform, at a fraction of the time and cost required to do so from scratch.”
“These technologies are already being used by the pharmaceutical industry individually, saving millions of dollars. Working together, as an integrated platform, their impact will be amplified,” added Al O. Pacino II, an ACRES VP.
The ACRES Global site started registering participants in the fall of 2013 and ultimately plans a $10 million investment in the system supported by industry stakeholders. “ACRES vision is to work collaboratively with stakeholders to build a non-proprietary shared IT platform for clinical research that incorporate standards ensuring inter-operability and inter-change of data while safeguarding privacy and security,” said ACRES President Dr. Greg Koski. “More than a portal, this interface allows sites to share their capabilities and get involved. While just the first step down a long road, it marks a critically important milestone.”

September 08, 2014 - Healthcare organizations in the state of California can apply for some extra help with their data analytics and health information governance efforts through the Safety Net Analytics Program (SNAP) offered by the Center for Care Innovations and the California HealthCare Foundation (CHCF).  The 14-month SNAP initiative will help organizations develop and apply foundational knowledge of clinical and financial analytics to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes.
“As more and more of California’s providers use health IT systems, the safety net has access to a wealth of new data about their patients and their community,” wrote SA Kushinka, Director of Programs at the Center for Care Innovations. “What we need now is to build a strong foundation of people, processes and technology to leverage that data to improve care and strengthen the organizations that serve the underserved.”
Non-profit providers, including community clinics, ambulatory and primary care clinics, and American Indian Health Centers can apply for one of twenty spots in the program.  Applications can be sent online and are due by September 22, 2014.

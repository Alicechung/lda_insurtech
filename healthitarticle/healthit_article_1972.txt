Multispecialty diabetes registry to foster clinical analytics

June 13, 2014

By Jennifer Bresnick
June 13, 2014 - A first-of-its kind patient registry targeting diabetes will bring clinical analytics to a multitude of specialties and research partners, announced Joslin Diabetes Center, pharmaceutical maker AstraZeneca, the American College of Cardiology, the American Diabetes Association, and the American College of Physicians.  The consortium will develop and maintain a databank of longitudinal patient information allowing providers to track performance measures, medication adherence, and quality improvement.  The registry will encourage providers across a multitude of specialties to collaborate on chronic disease management and improving outcomes for patients with multiple complaints.
“Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among people with diabetes, and there is a clear need for cross-specialty management of diabetes patients,” said American College of Cardiology President Patrick T. O’Gara, MD, FACC. “By consolidating patient data, this registry will allow primary care physicians and specialists who treat patients with diabetes to compare data and access real-time metrics on patients in all stages of the disease.”
“Internal medicine physician specialists are on the front lines of diabetes care,” added American College of Physicians President David A. Fleming, MD, FACP. “The Diabetes Collaborative Registry will enable effective and patient-centered communication among doctors across specialties, an especially important component for high value care of patients with diseases like diabetes that often have coexisting illnesses.”
Financial support from AstraZeneca will help the Diabetes Collaborative Registry to leverage the power of the ACC’s existing PINNACLE Registry, the largest ambulatory cardiovascular registry yet developed.  The PINNACLE platform will help to retrieve EHR data from participating providers to generate new insights and a better understanding of how diabetes causes and interacts with other disease states.

“Diabetes is not one disease but a complex set of diseases and too often leads to serious and potentially life-threatening complications, such as cardiovascular and kidney disease, as well as nerve damage, amputation, blindness and a multitude of other health problems,” said American Diabetes Association Chief Scientific and Medical Officer Robert E. Ratner, MD, FACP, FACE. “We hope that a cross-specialty, clinical registry will ultimately allow us to improve the quality of care—and therefore quality of life—for all people living with diabetes by giving researchers a clearer picture of what’s happening to patients at various stages of their disease. Improved data collection should help us improve patient outcomes.”

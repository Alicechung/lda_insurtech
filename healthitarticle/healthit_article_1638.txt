January 16, 2015 - Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University  has been chosen to lead the Bravewell Integrative Medicine Research Network (BraveNet), a collaboration of 14 US medicine centers. As the leader of Bravenet, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University will also manage the Patients Receiving Integrative Medicine Interventions Effectiveness Registry (PRIMIER), the first clinical data registry to combine traditional and alternative medical practices.
PRIMER is a patient registry that compiles electronic health record (EHR) data and other patient information  into a comprehensive data set which can then be used to improve patient care quality and to better determine which practices to use.The registry also helps to provide informed decision-making information for clinical trials.
“Registries are unique in that they allow researchers to examine patient subsets to precisely determine how individual patients benefit from each intervention. The process is cost-effective and allows researchers to gather evidence on a much larger scale than in a typical clinical trial.” Said M. Diane McKee, M.D., M.S., co-director of research and attending physician in the department of family and social medicine at Einstein and Montefiore Medical Center
A press release from Digital Journal, indicates that the patient registry industry is anticipated to grow from $381.0 million in 2014 to $610.8 million by 2019.

How will Stage 2 Meaningful Use impact clinical analytics?

January 20, 2014

By Jennifer Bresnick
January 20, 2014 - 2014 is a game-changing year in healthcare, and will ask providers to contend with major adjustments including coding changes, new patient populations, new technology, and new ways of thinking about the art and science of medicine.  Among these changes is the beginning of Stage 2 of the EHR Incentive Programs, which will require providers to step up their data science know-how and integrate informatics into the workflow whether they realize it or not.
While eligible professionals (EPs) and hospitals will take slightly different paths during this second phase of meaningful use, the goals remain the same for all participants: collect better data on patients, learn how to use it, and foster an environment that creates better overall health.
Clinical quality measures
At the heart of Stage 2 lie the clinical quality measures (CQMs), and a new rule that directs providers to submit their data electronically after 2014 if they are beyond their first year of participation. EPs must report on a relatively minimal nine out of 64 CQMs, and hospitals must pick 16 out of 29, spreading their choices throughout three of six major areas.

Q&A: Analytics raised quality so much, the gov’t didn’t believe it
Electronic collection and submission of quality data isn’t just a convenience for data processors in their cubicles at CMS.  It’s a core competency that all providers must have in order to move into analytics, whether as part of CMS incentive programs or not.  The data collected for CQMs has many applications – as long as hospitals and providers are sure that they are collecting enough of the right data in order to make it useful for further examination.
Patient engagement
Much has been made of the infamous 5% patient engagement threshold that has left many providers uncertain about their ability to successfully attest.  Offering an online patient portal is one thing, but getting people to use it is quite another.  Providers who serve low-income or non-English speaking patients, many of whom lack computer knowledge, have expressed a great deal of concern over the ability to grab patients in their homes or on their cell phones and persuade them to care about downloading their records.
But for those with an eye towards retooling their organization to embrace the principles of population health management and accountable care, patient portal use might be the easiest part.  “First and foremost, things should be organized around the patient,” suggests Matt Mattox, VP of Products and Marketing at Axial Exchange “Ideally we would allow for a broader sense of a care community to include caregivers and family members that you as the patient can provision access to.  The long-term vision should include information and tools that enable a patient to manage whatever their health goal is.”
Integrating patient portal use into an overall engagement and preventative care plan, including providing computer access and tutorials for those who might not have PCs at home, can satisfy both the Stage 2 requirement and the accountable care plans that many major payers are starting to demand in order for providers to receive reimbursements.
Care summaries and health information exchange
The third major hurdle of the Stage 2 roadmap is the emphasis on greater care coordination through data exchange.  From clinical care summaries to medication lists to proving the capability to exchange this data with other organizations, EHR aren’t just a data input tool anymore.  They are becoming data distribution hubs that will eventually allow providers to collect, share, and most importantly, to analyze large sets of data that will be able to predict high risk patients, flag drug interactions, and proactively address adverse events that are harmful and costly.
While Stage 2 will certainly challenge providers to retool their workflows and implement more robust technological infrastructure, the impact for analytics, which will be a focus in Stage 3, will be huge. Stage 2 is when providers will learn how to adopt and wield the necessary tools that will bring data into the daily routine.  Meaningful use is slowly but surely setting the stage for an integrated, coordinated, data-driven healthcare system that will revolve around the patient’s need to achieve optimal health instead of just patching up problems after they occur.

Many psychiatrists, providers haven’t moved to DSM-5

August 19, 2014 - There’s more to health information management than ICD-10 and SNOMED, and for providers who routinely deal with mental health disorders, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) is the latest standard medical coding language that is enduring widespread skepticism or claims of irrelevance.  About a third of providers, including psychiatrists, who see patients with mental health disorders have not upgraded to the newest iteration of the DSM handbook, according to a Medscape survey, citing several contentious issues such as changes to the way the codes define autism and other disorders.
Just 60% of psychologists and 59% of psychiatrists have adopted the new manual.  Non-adopters cited a lack of relevance to their practice, unfamiliarity with the recent update, and the language’s irrelevance for billing as primary reasons why they have snubbed the definitions.
Controversy over the consolidation of autism disorders into one single “autism spectrum” category has also influenced the way providers view the DMS-5, with some practitioners worrying that the new definition will limit accessibility to social support and other services for patients.
“Our survey suggests that plenty of clinicians encountering mental health patients are, for a variety of reasons, not using DSM-5. However, the majority of those who have adopted the manual seem relatively satisfied,” write study authors Bret S. Stetka, MD, and Nassir Ghaemi, MD, MPH. “More and more clinicians will no doubt begin using the manual as it is increasingly adopted by employers and electronic health record systems. Hopefully, future DSM-5 revisions will further improve clinical accuracy and utility, while addressing shortcomings revealed by increasing experience with the manual.”

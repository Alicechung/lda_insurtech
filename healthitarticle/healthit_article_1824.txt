September 25, 2014 - A new clinical trial is aiming at discovering how the packaging of medications and instructions provided by pharmacists affect patient adherence.  The STOMPP (Study the Effect of a Hybrid Pharmacy Practice Model on Medication Adherence) trial will enroll up to 300 patients with metabolic syndrome or Type 2 diabetes to examine if care quality and chronic disease management can be improved with clearer labels, simplified instruction, and more personal attention from community pharmacists.
“Beyond the designed end points of this study, one early observation is the sheer number of individuals who are enthusiastic about being enrolled in a study of this kind,” said Dr. Sharrel Pinto, Division Head and Associate Professor in the Health Outcomes and Socioeconomic Sciences Division and Research Director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Care and Outcomes Research at The University of Toledo College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.
“Findings from my focus group study, presented earlier this year at the American Pharmacists Association, have provided early evidence that the adherence packs help in improving medication adherence and keeping patients healthy and out of the hospital. Individuals and their families are anxious for a solution that will help them take medications on time, as directed, and track their adherence after the fact. As a pharmacist, I share responsibility with prescribing physicians, caregivers, and patients themselves to all do our part in ensuring the patient’s future health and wellness. We expect STOMPP will quantify what we’ve learned to date.”

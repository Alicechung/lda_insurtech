September 02, 2014 - Researchers in North Carolina are helping to foster population health management and disease control efforts in developing nations by studying data integrity techniques and sharing their knowledge with the help of a $180 million grant from the US Agency for International Development (USAID).  The money will help data scientists at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill’s Population Center to drive better decision making in regions where healthcare infrastructure and data analytics are in their beginning stages.
“More and more, policymakers are asking for better data,” said Robert Clay, deputy assistant administrator for USAID. “Resources are getting tighter. In that situation, policymakers are asking, ‘Where should we invest? Where can we have the biggest impact?’ And that requires robust data.”
UNC professor Jim C. Thomas is leading USAID’s long-term data collection project, called the MEASURE Evaluation, which was first developed in 1998 to reduce spending, cut waste, and bolster healthcare delivery services.  The new grant will support the program for another five years as it completes missions like training data auditors in Nigeria to improve HIV/AIDS information collection and providing support to combat the deadly Ebola epidemic raging in some Western African nations.

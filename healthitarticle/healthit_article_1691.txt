FDA Approves Blood Test that Predicts Coronary Heart Disease

December 16, 2014 - A blood test that is particularly effective for predicting the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) in black women has passed the FDA’s approval process.  The screening detects levels of a biological marker associated with vascular inflammation, which in turn can predict the development of plaque that leads to heart attacks and heart disease.
“A cardiac test that helps better predict future CHD risk in women, and especially black women, may help health care professionals identify these patients before they experience a serious CHD event, like a heart attack,” said Alberto Gutierrez, director of the Office of In-Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “We hope the clearance of this test will improve preventative care and reduce CHD-related mortality and morbidity in these patients.”
The validation study for the PLAC Test for Lp-PLA2 Activity involved nearly 4600 adult patients with no history of heart disease.  The patients were followed over a median of 5.3 years.  Patients with higher readings from the test were approximately twice as likely to experience a cardiac event as those with test results below the threshold.  The test was especially pertinent for black women, whose chances of a cardiac event exceeded those of other groups when exhibiting a higher score.
The FDA hopes that better screenings will help to prevent some of the 385,000 annual deaths from CHD, many of which occur without the manifestation of notable symptoms.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Americans in most racial ethnic groups, and can develop in patients of all ages and backgrounds.

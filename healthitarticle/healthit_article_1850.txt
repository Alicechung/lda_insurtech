September 11, 2014 - Big data will only be getting bigger over the next few years as the global market for analytics technology continues to grow at a staggering rate, says a report from TechNavio.  The global big data services market is slated to expand at 32.14% between 2014 and 2018, with vendors such as Accenture, IBM, HP, and PricewaterhouseCoopers leading the way.
“The consolidation in the Global Big Data market is increasing as many large enterprise-computing vendors are acquiring companies to provide new big data technologies,” said a report analyst. “Large vendors are targeting small companies to expand their business portfolios and are acquiring major pure-play big data vendors. Through acquisitions, large enterprise computing vendors are trying to enhance their capabilities to deliver a comprehensive big data solution.”
The capability to provide predictive analytics is one of the key drivers of the market as organizations look to improve efficiency, tighten business processes, and make better decisions.  However, many organizations still have trouble understanding the concept of big data and retooling their data input and storage processes to make analytics viable.

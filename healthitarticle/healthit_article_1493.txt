April 14, 2015 - Partners HealthCare and Samsung Electronics announced a new partnership at HIMSS15 today centered on the use of remote monitoring technologies and mHealth to improve chronic disease management.
Partners HealthCare, a Boston-based integrated health system that includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, will work with Samsung’s Digital Media and Communications R&D Center to develop clinical research and software that connects patients with secure, mobile chronic disease management tools.  These tools will provide remote monitoring that promotes patient engagement, medication adherence, patient-generated health data, and effective self-management.
“We are excited to have access to the vast capabilities of Samsung Electronics to help improve the way we deliver care to our patients. This joint development program has the potential to significantly propel mHealth and personal connected health forward,” said Kamal Jethwani, MD, MPH, Senior Director of Connected Health Innovation at Partners HealthCare. “This project represents the start of how smart technology, intelligent algorithms and world class clinical expertise can be combined to change the paradigm of care delivery.”
“This unprecedented new partnership brings to bear the unique strengths of Samsung Electronics, the Partners Connected Health team and our leading healthcare providers, to expand the boundaries of digital health technology,” added Joseph C. Kvedar, MD, Vice President of Connected Health at Partners HealthCare. “Combining our real-world clinical experience and implementation of connected health solutions with their leading mobile and IT technology, we believe that, together, we can re-imagine the future of health and wellness and deliver innovative, convenient and powerful personal connected health tools.”

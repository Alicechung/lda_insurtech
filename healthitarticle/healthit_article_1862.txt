September 05, 2014 - Patient-generated health data (PGHD) provided by wearable devices is set for a massive explosion in volume over the next five years, according to a report from ABI Research.  Close to 100 million wearable remote patient monitoring devices will be sold and shipped by 2019 as patients desire easier, more intuitive ways to monitor their health on an ongoing basis.
“Data has traditionally resided in silos belonging to specific applications delivered primarily by device vendors themselves. New cloud platforms capable of collecting data from a range of vendor devices and sharing it securely with a range of related parties including patients, healthcare providers, and payers will drive adoption and bring more connected devices to market,” said Jonathan Collins, principal analyst at ABI Research.
With the proliferation of increasingly elaborate fitness trackers and smartwatches that promise seamless data streaming to the cloud – or even directly to a provider’s EHR – patients will be inundated with new methods of data collection, while providers will be challenged to identify important pieces of health information in a stream of generally meaningless statistics.

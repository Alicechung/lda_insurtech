April 13, 2015 - Big data analytics is the next step in the healthcare industry’s ongoing process of adopting health IT infrastructure, American Medical Association (AMA) President Robert Wah, MD told attendees at HIMSS15 in a keynote address delivered during the Innovation Symposium.  The AMA is unveiling its physician leadership strategies to help guide healthcare organizations through its digital transformation.
While the first phase of healthcare’s digital transformation involved the adoption of EHR systems and the second requires organizations to engage in EHR interoperability, the third rung on the ladder of leveraging health IT capabilities is using big data analytics to garner actionable insights into clinical care and financial opportunities.
“What we’ll see emerging in the third phase are new capabilities to analyze digital data that will provide insights for efficient, high-quality care,” said Wah in an emailed press release. ”In these rapidly changing times in healthcare, we will need agile technology to adapt and succeed. To harness these capabilities, physicians are leading new approaches for delivery and payment of medical services, and challenging regulatory barriers holding back the promise of information technology in health care.”
The AMA is committed to helping healthcare providers leverage current regulatory initiatives to boost innovation, achieve a measurable return on their investment into EHR infrastructure and big data analytics capabilities, and effectively utilize emerging technologies like telehealth, mHealth, and remote patient monitoring devices to keep patients connected to the care continuum in an effort to reduce spending and manage population health.

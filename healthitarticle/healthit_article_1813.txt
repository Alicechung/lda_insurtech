October 06, 2014 - The Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) is asking healthcare providers to discuss their progress towards four key areas of healthcare reform identified in its 2013 annual report.  Organizations can take the WEDI survey to highlight their work on patient engagement, payment model reform, data harmonization and health information exchange, and innovative encounter models to share their experiences with peers.
“As the 20th anniversary update to the original 1993 WEDI Report, our 2013 WEDI Report has been at the forefront of many discussions of reshaping the healthcare environment for the years to come. We envision a healthcare arena that harbors greater efficiency, an unwavering trust among stakeholders, affordable and effective care for patients, and one that eliminates costly barriers to productive innovation,” said WEDI President and CEO Devin Jopp, EdD.
“No small feat for sure, but as WEDI seeks to help guide the industry, it takes all parties to make this vision a reality. This reporting initiative will allow us to effectively monitor the industry’s movements toward these goals.”

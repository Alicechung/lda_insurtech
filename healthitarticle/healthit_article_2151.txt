December 17, 2013 - The Kurt+Peter Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to research into Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy, Type 2C, also known as gamma sarcoglycanopathy (LGMD2C), has announced the formation of the first patient registry focused solely on the crippling disease, bringing hope for more coordinated, detailed research into the condition.
The registration form collects detailed information about the family history, diagnosis, and progression of the disease, which typically strikes children between the ages of 4 and 12, robbing them of the ability to walk by their teenage years.
“Recent research provides reason for optimism that clinical trials for therapies for LGMD2C are not too far in the future,” said Dr. Elizabeth McNally of the University of Chicago, a leading LGMD2C researcher. “A registry such as the one created by the Kurt+Peter Foundation will be important for identifying and registering patients.”
“We are excited to have developed and released this registry that will allow patients to register for research for an underdiagnosed and severe disease that impacts children worldwide,” added Scott Frewing, president of the Kurt+Peter Foundation.   The organization was named after two of Frewing’s children, who are both afflicted with the condition.  “The registry will allow clinicians to identify patients and share that information to assist clinical trials.”

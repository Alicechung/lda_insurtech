November 19, 2014 - NYU Langone Medical Center and Lutheran Medical Center intend to form a clinically integrated network to help providers within the system focus on care coordination, population health management, and advanced care supported by clinical analytics, the two organizations announced this week.  The medical centers are seeking regulatory approval and hope to finalize the partnership in 2015.
“We have been working closely with Lutheran over the last several months to assess whether a partnership would benefit each of our institutions, the Brooklyn community and, most importantly, the patients and families who turn to us for help,” said Robert I. Grossman, MD, dean and CEO of NYU Langone.  “Today’s agreement publicly confirms our confidence that an affiliation will allow both of our institutions to collaborate and share best practices to better meet the healthcare needs of the communities we serve.”
“Our talks with NYU Langone have been successful because of the great respect they have for Lutheran and what we have built over the years,” added Lutheran President and CEO Wendy Z. Goldshein. “We are proud of the fact that we have created and continue to foster an extraordinarily effective and efficient delivery system that succeeds because of our ability to deliver low cost, high quality care.”
NYU Langone includes four hospitals and the NYU School of Medicine, while Lutheran HealthCare includes academic, community health care, and social support organizations as well as a Level 3 Patient-Centered Medical Home.

November 13, 2014 - The $694.7 million predictive analytics market in North America is slated to grow at a 24.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) until 2019, says a new report by MicroMarket Monitor.   The global market for predictive technologies that help healthcare organizations, among others, derive actionable insights from existing data, is predicted to grow even faster at 32.3% CAGR during the same time period.  North American organizations currently hold a 38.8% share of the global market, with familiar companies such as SAP, IBM, and Oracle, all of whom have healthcare verticals, ranking among the leaders in the industry.
The report is in line with other market research predictions that show rapid growth for big data analytics as healthcare organizations join other industries in harnessing huge quantities of information that can help to improve quality and customer satisfaction while reducing errors and cutting extraneous spending.  A TechNavio report from earlier in the fall expects that the global market for big data technologies will grow at 32.14% CAGR between 2014 and 2018, while the healthcare-specific analytics market is on track to expand at a 25% CAGR for the next five years according to Research and Markets.

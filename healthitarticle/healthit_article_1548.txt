March 10, 2015 - The Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) is asking the healthcare industry to participate in a poll to gauge the financial impacts of health information exchange and health IT interoperability.  In an effort to quantify whether stakeholders are seeing any meaningful return on investment (ROI) after purchasing and implementing health information exchange technologies, the survey is open to providers, vendors, payers, and post-acute care facilities.
“The purpose of this important WEDI survey is to help understand – from the perspective of major healthcare sectors – where we are now in regards to interoperability and what respondents believe the value is of enhanced data exchange capabilities,” said Devin Jopp, EdD, president and CEO, WEDI.
“We’re also asking industry leaders to share with us their perspectives on the national patient identifier, which was required under HIPAA but never developed. The results of this survey will not only shape our discussions with ONC, but also our efforts to promote industry-developed solutions that will lead to enhanced clinical care and improved administrative efficiencies.”
The survey closes to responses on March 23, 2015.  Interested parties can access the poll by clicking here.

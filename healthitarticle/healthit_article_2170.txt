December 04, 2013 - Nancy Staggers, RN, PhD, FAAN received the prestigious Virginia K. Saba Informatics Award last month from the American Medical Informatics Association, marking nearly three decades of achievement in academic and practical informatics.
“Informatics tools have gone from novel and rare to essential and commonplace,” Staggers said. “It is a very exciting area of work. I’m pleased to have been a part of the initial road integrating these tools into healthcare and into the nursing arena and am humbled by the recognition from my colleagues.”
The award recognizes contributions to nursing through informatics in professional practice, education, administration, research, and health policy.  Staggers is currently a professor at the University of Maryland School of Nursing, and has been involved in leading EHR projects for the Department of Defense as well as helping other institutions complete the transition from paper to electronic records.  She has published numerous academic papers and has been actively involved in creating policy for nurse informaticists across the country.

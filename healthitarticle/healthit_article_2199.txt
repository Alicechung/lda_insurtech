How can providers manage and use unsolicited patient data?

November 14, 2013

By Jennifer Bresnick
November 14, 2013 - There’s been plenty of talk about how great it is that patients are getting involved in their care, and how wonderful it is to compile a complete picture of a patient’s health by gathering and accessing multiple streams of data.  But it’s important to remember that patients and providers often have a different idea of what’s important, and patients may often send documents from specialists, emergency rooms, home health monitors, mobile apps, or previous physicians without thinking about what the influx of that data is doing to organization and management of their EHR data.  As data increasingly flows from a variety of non-traditional sources, how can health information managers ensure that a patient’s information is received, stored, and presented in a way that providers can use?
“In its most simple form, unrequested information is data received by a healthcare provider who has taken no active steps to ask for or collect that information. This unsolicited data can arrive in a variety of formats from paper to electronic media,” explains a recent issue brief developed by a team of HIM specialists at AHIMA.  As payers and providers alike place more emphasis on the continuum of care, primary care providers may start seeing an increase in cross-provider communications, which can be good and bad at the same time.
HIM staff should be aware of the workflow challenges that these new data sources will bring, both to the administrative staff receiving faxes, envelopes, and CDs, and for the clinical staff charged with reviewing the materials for pertinent data.  While paper charts allowed staff to tuck a piece of paper under the right tab and forget about it, EHRs demand an additional step: turning paper correspondence into electronic form – and extracting the right data to add to a patient’s chart or use for analytics, quality measures, and other tracking projects.
Legacy Health, a network of hospitals and clinics that recently achieved Stage 7 on the HIMSS Analytics EMRAM scale, funnels all its paper patient documents, unsolicited and otherwise, through a central office that scans each piece of data and assigns it to the appropriate EHR chart before a physician ever sees it.  This process allows the HIM staff to ensure the quality of data provided by other sources while making it simple for physicians to access new data when needed.

Why are hospitals data rich but lacking in data analytics?
The AHIMA brief recommends that healthcare organizations establish standard protocols for what information should be added to the EHR. “Some documents have succinct summaries of relevant information that supports the longitudinal record and clinical decisions. For example, if the unsolicited records contain a discharge summary, that document might be retained. Conversely, months of inpatient progress notes might not hold the same long-term clinical value. As a rule of thumb, always include any record that is used to make a decision about the diagnosis or treatment of the patient.”
And always review the data thoroughly, even if it seems irrelevant or takes extra time, AHIMA urges.  “Legal ramifications may occur if inadequate review of received unsolicited health information leads to ill-informed medical decisions or missed diagnoses,” the report warns. “Providers that accept unsolicited information without completing a review may be held responsible for knowing the information is housed in their legal health record.”
While unasked for data can be cumbersome to sort through, it’s a necessary evil for a variety of reasons.  Not only can multiple sources of information help present a richer picture of an individual patient’s health, it can ease care transitions and give providers and analytics teams a better idea of local utilization of services to aid in the appropriate allocation of resources.  As part of the ongoing effort to retool healthcare organizations to embrace patient data as a valuable asset, HIM professionals should work to establish protocols to accept, review, and leverage all the data resources available, whether the information is expected or not.

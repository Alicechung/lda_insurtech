August 29, 2014 - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced the release of its finalized guidelines for genomic data sharing and research.  After receiving more than one hundred public comments on the draft of the policies, NIH has clarified and revised the guidelines, which encourage the dissemination and exchange of data to support the industry’s ongoing quest for improved diagnosis and treatment of genetic conditions.
“Sharing research data supports the NIH mission and is essential to facilitate the translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures that improve human health,” the policy says. “The NIH has longstanding policies to make a broad range of research data, in addition to genomic data, publicly available in a timely manner from the research activities that it funds.”
The full set of guidelines is available here.

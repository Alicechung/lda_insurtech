November 05, 2013 - The Florida Council for Community Mental Health (FCCMH) will be embarking on a first-of-its-kind project to aggregate deidentified mental health and addiction data on a state-wide level for broad analytics.  The data from participating agencies will be used to provide real-time insight into costs, productivity, and patient outcomes.
“This significant project will help identify the most effective outcomes measures that can be proposed to the State of Florida to drive accountable care in an emerging pay-for-performance environment,” said Bob Sharpe, president and chief executive officer, FCCMH. “It will also help our members aggregate a wide array of complex, dispersed data and use it to enhance the effectiveness of their clinical practices and programs.”
FCCMH includes nearly 60 community-based mental health and addiction centers, including agencies that specialize in children’s services, substance abuse, and hospital-based programs.  Nine of the Council’s member organizations have already signed up for the program, which is facilitated by Netsmart’s Enlighten Analytics product.

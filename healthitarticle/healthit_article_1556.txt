New EHRA Workgroup to Focus on Health IT, Accountable Care

March 05, 2015 - A new workgroup from the HIMSS Electronic Health Record Association (EHRA) will focus on developing and disseminating best practices for leveraging health IT to speed the spread of accountable care, improve patient safety, raise quality, and guide the adoption of value-based reimbursements.  Announced late last month, the Delivery System Reform Workgroup will facilitate discussion and provide information to the EHR vendor community as it works with a variety of stakeholders to achieve accountable care goals.
“There is a central relationship between health IT and the significant delivery system and payment reform efforts currently underway to shift healthcare toward value-based and integrated care models,” said Mark Segal, PhD, EHRA Chair and  Vice President of Government and Industry Affairs at GE Healthcare IT. “Our members, whose clients are the majority of hospitals and ambulatory organizations using EHRs to improve the efficiency and quality of patient care, offer many products and services that extend beyond traditional EHRs, while leveraging EHR data or integrating with EHR technology.”
“We anticipate a variety of payment and delivery reform initiatives that will continue to have a profound effect on the healthcare providers that we serve,” continued Segal. “These professionals and organizations rely upon us for education on how EHRs and other health IT can provide solutions to high-impact regulatory and market changes.”
EHRA Vice Chair Sarah Corley, MD, FACP, Chief Medical Officer at NextGen Healthcare, added, “We are seeing the real convergence of what has been traditionally siloed as clinical data and financial data into healthcare information that is essential to the success of accountable care organizations and new payment models.”

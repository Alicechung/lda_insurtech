February 05, 2015 - Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret Hamburg has announced her resignation from the agency’s top post just days after kicking off President Obama’s “precision medicine” initiative.  While serving nearly six years in the position, Hamburg brought the FDA into an era of increased regulation – not all of it satisfactory to the healthcare industry.  She leaves FDA Chief Scientist Stephen Ostroff as her temporary replacement, Reuters reports.
Hamburg’s farewell letter to staff called her time at the FDA the “most rewarding” of her career.  “At the heart of all of these accomplishments is a strong commitment to science as the foundation of our regulatory decision-making and of our integrity as an agency,” she said.
Hamburg’s tenure has been marked by increased FDA involvement in the oversight of mHealth devices, including the release of long-awaited final guidance, and the rise of genomic medicine, which presents significant regulatory challenges.  Hamburg is a graduate of Harvard Medical School who previous served at the National Institutes of Health and as New York City’s health commissioner before being appointed to her federal post in 2009.

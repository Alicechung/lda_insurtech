September 12, 2014 - Aetna and more than 1200 Weill Cornell physicians will collaborate on a newly announced accountable care agreement, the payer says, intended to boost the coordination of care and provide higher quality services to more than 9000 New York patients with commercial and Medicare insurance.
The Weill Cornell Physicians Organization will receive recognition for meeting quality and efficiency benchmarks while expanding its care management team to improve coordination and population health management.  Nurse case managers will work with providers and patients to tackle chronic diseases and medication adherence in an effort to produce lower costs and better quality of life for patients.
“Aetna and Weill Cornell Physicians share the responsibility of giving the 9,000 New Yorkers we both serve high-quality, efficient and coordinated care,” said David Kobus, Aetna senior vice president, New York Network. “As with all members, we want these shared customers to feel well and to feel supported by their personal healthcare system. Together, Aetna and Weill Cornell are stepping forward to collaborate and share in the accountability of positive patient outcomes.”
“This collaboration will add to the effort of aligning our Weill Cornell faculty with the Triple Aim of improving quality, lowering costs, and performing population-health management,” added Michael Wolk, MD, MACC, chair of the Weill Cornell Physicians’ Managed Care Committee.

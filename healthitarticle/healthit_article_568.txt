February 16, 2017 - Care management content provided by xG Health Solutions, powered by Geisinger, will be available within Epic’s Healthy Planet product, allowing users to access evidence-based care guidelines, patient assessment frameworks, and care plans for 60 common conditions.
"We're thrilled about our agreement with Epic because it will enable the large number of providers who use Epic's EMR and Healthy Planet to take advantage of the evidence-based clinical protocols and efficiency-driving workflows that Geisinger and xG Health have developed," said Earl P. Steinberg, MD, MPP, CEO, xG Health Solutions.
The tool will allow providers using the nation’s most widely adopted health IT system to develop tailored care plans for patients, aiding in chronic disease management and preventive care.

"xG has created content that will help ensure patients are receiving appropriate care and case management services," said Carl Dvorak, President of Epic. "We hope our open platform will continue to encourage xG and others to expand their offerings to the Epic community."
Last year, xG announced a similar collaboration with Cerner Corporation’s population health management and big data analytics platforms. 
“By aligning with xG, a market leader in population health analytics, we will greatly enhance our capabilities around delivering actionable insights to help organizations effectively manage at-risk populations,” Lisa McDermott, vice president of population health at Cerner, said at the time.

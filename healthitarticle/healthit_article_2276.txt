September 18, 2013 - Hospitals are seeing the value within their own EHR systems when it comes to healthcare analytics, according to new data from the HIMSS Analytics 2013 U.S. Clinical & Business Intelligence Study.  More than 50% of hospitals that use a clinical and business intelligence (C&BI) system draw data from their EHRs, the survey says.
“Our findings indicate that the current focus in the marketplace is on managing, extracting and analyzing data via embedded tools within organizations’ HIS / EMR solutions,” said Brendan FitzGerald, HIMSS Analytics Research Director.
This includes the widespread use of enterprise data warehouses, with fewer hospitals using operational data stores or transactional systems to keep their data secure.  The survey also found that hospitals are more likely to use current solutions for data analytics rather than purchase a best-of-breed C&BI solution from a vendor.

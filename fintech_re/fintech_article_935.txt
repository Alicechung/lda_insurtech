How to advertise?

6 lights go off …

 The six giant advertising billboards, Piccadilly lights, are going offline for at least 6 months. In the past, the only time the Piccadilly Lights were switched off was during World War II, for Winston Churchill’s funeral in 1965 and Princess Diana’s funeral in 1997. Owned and operated by Land Securities, the six advertising hoardings at the landmark Piccadilly Lights are to become one giant curved screen, re opening in the Autumn. Until then the existing advertising screens will be covered by scaffolding and, you guessed it, adverts.

 600 go on….

 Meanwhile, Flow.City continue to expand their taxi top coverage, with 600 cabs now in the network. So if your marketing budget doesn’t extend to the £30M required for Piccadilly lights, you can always have 600 taxis doing the work for around 0.001% of the price.

Small Business Saturday UK: Automatic enrolment problems? The PLSA has a Pension Solution

December 2, 2016

Small Business Saturday takes place on the first Saturday in December each year. It is a grassroots, non-commercial campaign, which highlights small business success and encourages consumers to ‘shop local’ and support small businesses. In 2016 Small Business Saturday will take place tomorrow, on Saturday 3rd December.
The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association is delighted to be supporting Small Business Saturday. Check out our new blog post about the impact of automatic enrolment on small businesses, and plans to support the campaign again this year.

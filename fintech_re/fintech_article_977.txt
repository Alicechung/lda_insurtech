Have you heard of Rainmaker Fundraiser? If not, you should.

December 19, 2016

Join us to mark the culmination of our charities’ accelerator journey by taking part in our Rainmaker Fundraiser on the 30th January.

 We will be bringing together the most exciting business minds from our Rainmaker community and groundbreaking charities from our accelerator, for a live crowdfunding event to launch our graduates into their next stage of growth.

 10 charities will come together to give 3 pitches on their collective impact to empower women, support young people and disrupt the criminal justice system. In just six minutes of live crowdfunding we will touch the lives of all their beneficiaries and inspire generosity across the Rainmaker community.

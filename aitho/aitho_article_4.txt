Digital Adoption Platform to Revolutionize SaaS Implementations
LeapPoint, a management and technology consulting firm, is excited to announce it has acquired browser-based digital adoption platform, JumpSeat (jumpseat.io). This platform allows companies to streamline their onboarding process and technology adoption efforts. JumpSeat is a browser-based solution allowing it to be utilized across the many different technologies a company has in its stack. Management and specialists can create tutorials and training modules that appear within the application itself — instead of inside a separate program. Employees see these guides, tutorials, and indicators overlaid on their actual software helping them to more quickly and effectively learn how to use it. JumpSeat joins LeapPoint’s other turnkey technology products: DataConnect, LeapPoint One, and various cloud add-ons for Workfront, Salesforce, SAP, and more.

LeapPoint has a long history of providing strategic advisory and technology implementation services in a broad array of disciplines including finance, IT, marketing, and the federal government. Founded in 2006 with the belief that the most important outcome of their work is the success of other companies, LeapPoint’s mission stays constant to this day: drive enterprise change for organizations. The acquisition of JumpSeat is a fulfillment of that mission. It allows a new employee to begin working almost immediately — with minimal ramp-up time — as instructions and tutorials will appear over top of the browser. The same goes for experienced employees learning to use new applications or systems. In addition to the user-facing features, JumpSeat also provides metrics tracking and reports to help management understand weak points in learning.

In another successful implementation of JumpSeat, a global luxury brand was able to future-proof their software by allowing them to customize learning experiences to their employees’ needs.

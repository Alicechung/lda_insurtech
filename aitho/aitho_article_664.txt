The Kongsberg Geospatial IRIS display technology enables multiple drones to be monitored simultaneously by a single operator and provides real-time calculation of aircraft separation and communications line-of-sight to enable BVLOS operations. IRIS will provide the flight range with real-time 2D and 3D visualization of airborne track and weather data, as well as geo-fencing capabilities.
“We’re very pleased to be working with an experienced UAS services provider like Arctic UAV” said Ranald McGillis, President of Kongsberg Geospatial. “Their expertise in Arctic logistics and their ability to manage large-scale projects provides an excellent and very unique use case for our technology.”

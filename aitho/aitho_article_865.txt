Visit booth 28073 at ISC West to see Salient’s featured integration with Nimbo, an intelligent security robot by Turing Video.
Nimbo is designed to detect security violations or anomalies and approach the area with light/audio/video warnings that correspond to the situation. It collects HD video evidence and pushes notifications to security personnel, including live video streaming to mobile devices.

Nimbo’s video is powered by Salient’s CompleteView VMS. CompleteView’s Dynamic Resolution Scaling allows faster remote callup of live video streams, enabling users to observe and respond to the security situation in real-time. Dynamic Resolution Scaling reduces the video bitrate to the smallest possible size without sacrificing frame rate or quality, allowing the Nimbo to operate on 4G data networks with the lowest data consumption and operating costs.
“In keeping with Salient’s commitment to advanced technologies, robotics and artificial intelligence are cornerstones of Salient’s approach to being the central hub of an advanced total security solution,” says Chris Meiter, President of Salient Systems. “CompleteView is the command and control application allowing users to plug in their preferred access, robotics, video analytics, and other technologies for a smarter and complete security solution.”

Available today, expanded website scanning features, new user interfaces and additional reporting capabilities simplifying GDPR and ePrivacy compliance
OneTrust, a global leader in marketing compliance and enterprise privacy management software, today announced updates to the OneTrust Cookie Consent and Website Scanning solution to help organizations with consent compliance in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) obligations. OneTrust’s Cookie Consent and Website Scanning solution is used on thousands of web and mobile sites, garnering billions of impressions across 35+ languages and is the most powerful and flexible solution for EU cookie compliance.
OneTrust has conducted extensive research on the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive and the upcoming ePrivacy Regulation and collaborated with various EU regulators to understand the expectations required of organizations to demonstrate compliance. These obligations require companies to inform visitors about their website’s data collection and tracking policies to provide users transparency, control and choice.
The OneTrust Cookie Consent and Website Scanning solution is built on this research and provides organizations a simple website plugin to comply with these rules. The OneTrust technology automatically scans a website to identify all trackers and allows you to generate a tailorable cookie consent banner, cookie preference center and detailed cookie disclosure for the organization. To prepare for the GDPR, OneTrust has collaborated with industry experts and regulators over the past year to roll out a series of updates to the Cookie Consent technology.

Expanded Website Scanning and Automation
Privacy regulations require transparency regarding cookie and non-cookie based tracking. The OneTrust Cookie Consent and Website Scanning technology identifies all available web and mobile tracking technologies, such as cookies, tags, beacons, tracking pixels, HTML 5 and local objects. OneTrust then automatically categorizes these tracking technologies against OneTrust’s Cookiepedia, the largest database of cookies and associated vendors in the world with nearly 6 million unique cookies. OneTrust can now also scan behind login pages and age verification pages to automatically log and detect additional trackers.
New User Interface Options
Depending on an organizations’ implementation of the GDPR, OneTrust provides flexibility and choice regarding consent type, such as opt-in or implied consent. Based on A/B testing, OneTrust developed new “overlay” user interfaces (UI) to help organizations maximize the number of users consenting to cookies by providing a consent UI that is relevant to that user’s region and provides the appropriate disclosures. OneTrust’s UI also honors the user’s pre-selected preferences such as “Do Not Track.”
The updated consent UIs can be integrated onto a website with a single JavaScript implementation, and can easily be customized to fit with the organization’s website and branding. The UI can also auto-detect the local language and display the appropriate wording to the end user with no additional scripting or coding needed. Additionally, a single preference center can be implemented across multiple domains, meaning users won’t be asked to update their cookie preferences across multiple web and mobile properties owned by the same organization.
These new user interface options fully support the IAB Europe Transparency & Consent Framework. OneTrust is the first privacy management technology to adopt this framework to make it easier for publishers and ad tech vendors to deliver personalized ads in compliance with regulatory requirements.

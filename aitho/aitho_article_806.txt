Commenting on the research, Dominique Raviart, IT Services Practice Director at NelsonHall, said: “Within IT services, the share of spending related to mature offerings will decrease which means vendors are now challenged to grow expertise in high growth offerings such as big data and analytics. With Atos Codex, Atos has invested in new technologies, addresses challenges such as fragmentation of software tools, and has created a large number of industry use cases. Atos is also investing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to bring further automation in analytics, and NelsonHall views this investment as very positive.”

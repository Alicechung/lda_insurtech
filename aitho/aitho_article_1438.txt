VantagePoint Forecasts Stocks, Futures, Forex, ETFs and Cryptocurrencies With Proven Forecasting Accuracy Of Up To 86%
VantagePoint, the artificial intelligence trading software capable of predicting stock market trends up to three days in advance with up to 86 percent forecasting accuracy, is rated “highly recommended” after multi-year tests performed by Terry Wooten, former editor for Dow Jones.
Wooten’s review, published in YourTradingEdge (YTE), highlights VantagePoint’s unique artificial intelligence forecasting capabilities that give traders a significant advantage over others who still rely on single-market, trend-following indicators that lag behind the markets. These outdated approaches look only at each individual market by itself, but fail to address the intermarket effects that related global markets have on the market.
“VantagePoint is a first-class tool to use to build profitable trading strategies,” Wooten said in the review. “VantagePoint will provide a definite statistical advantage that I have not seen elsewhere. An intelligent trader or investor should have no problem recouping the cost of the software quickly.  Highly recommended.”
VantagePoint’s version 10 — just released last week with the most significant updates to date — predicted the Dow’s largest single-day point drop which occurred Feb. 5, 2018 five days in advance. Traders using the software leveraged this valuable insight to make more informed trading decisions in advance of the historically volatile trading day.
The review, available now in the bi-monthly magazine for traders and active investors, also details VantagePoint’s ability to forecast Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum with the same high level of predictive accuracy achieved with all other markets it covers.

Users will have similar Alexa functionality in their cars as they do at home.  “We strive to provide our customers with the latest technology for their vehicles,” explains BOSS Audio’s VP of Sales, Doug Kern. “Our customers will be able to access the tens of thousands of available Alexa voice skills. They will be able to control their Alexa-enabled smart home products while driving, and before arriving home, using prompts like ‘Alexa, turn the heat on at 72 degrees’, ‘Alexa, close the garage door’.  They will be able to ask things like ‘Alexa tell me a joke’, ‘Alexa, what’s the news?’, ‘”Alexa, play country music,’ and more.”

PayBito provides a platform to list crypto assets based on merit unlike many of its peers where pay-to-list appears to be the norm.
An Enterprise launching a new crypto asset knows that getting their asset listed on a cryptocurrency exchange might be quite a daunting task.
A thorough vetting of an enterprise’s crypto asset before listing it is no longer the norm used by most exchanges. Pay-to-list appears to be the new normal.

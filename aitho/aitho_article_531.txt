PriorAuthNow’s revolutionary SaaS technology is a single resource to submit, monitor and complete prior authorizations for medical procedures and products and is used by hospitals, health systems, payers, laboratories and device manufacturers. Prior authorizations cost the United States healthcare system some $31 billion annually. It is an intensely manual process of phone calls, faxing and a myriad of payer portals that often results in unnecessary delays and denials in care. PriorAuthNow’s SaaS solution is the fastest, most economical way to submit, monitor and finalize authorizations.
“PriorAuthNow has been an invaluable asset to our office. We’ve been able to significantly reduce the time spent completing authorizations manually, which means we can devote more time directly to delivering exceptional patient care,” said Matt Brown, Physician Practice Administrator of the OhioHealth Physician Group. “The implementation with PriorAuthNow was remarkably smooth, and it’s greatly improved our efficiency and our ability to manage the process from end to end.”

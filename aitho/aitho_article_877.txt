About Gong. io: As a B2B sales leader, your biggest challenge is that too many of the opportunities that come into your pipeline fail to make their way through the sales process and into closed business. Gong’s conversation intelligence platform helps you ensure more of the deals that enter your pipeline actually come out as closed revenue by shining the light on your sales conversations. It records, transcribes, and analyzes all of your sales calls so you can drive sales effectiveness at scale, figure out what’s working and what’s not, and ramp new hires faster by helping them replicate your top performers.

Dr. Uwe Hommel Joins Bayestree’s Advisory Board

10 Jul 2018

Bayestree Intelligence Inc. is delighted to announce the formation of Advisory Board and the joining of Dr. Uwe Hommel as its very first member.
Uwe is a foremost global expert in Service Management having led SAP’s Global Support and Services worldwide for over two decades. It’s quite likely that most Fortune 500 running SAP owe a bit of their operations stability to Uwe and his team’s efforts. Over the years he has served over 50 thousand enterprises large and small across sectors and geographies consistently delivering on customer success and reducing cost of ownership.
On joining Bayestree’s Advisory Board, Uwe commented, “I am excited and looking forward to leveraging Sentient’s machine learning platform to realize so many of my ideas. Sentient already makes the traditional definition of ‘service level’ redundant. We can now take it to the next level and proactively initiate corrective actions and maybe even auto-heal. Imagine the power that businesses can have if their lights-on dollars could be diverted to growing toplines.”

Bayestree’s co-Founders Avijit Biswas and Girish Koppar have both been colleagues of Uwe in SAP. They said, “With Uwe in the mix it’s ’90s redux for us. We can today promise our customers that Sentient would bring not just the technology but the best that Service Management as a function has to offer.” Partha Pratim Ghosh, co-Founder and Chief Scientist of Bayestree commented, “I am looking forward to working with Uwe who worked formerly as a Mathematician with the Department of Mathematics at University of Chicago and Heidelberg where he has a Ph.D. in Algebraic Topology.”

IstoVisio and Pogo Linux Partner To Provide Pre-Configured VR Workstations For Scientific Research
IstoVisio, creators of the groundbreaking virtual reality data visualization application, syGlass, has partnered with Pogo Linux, a premier integrator of open-source workstations, servers, and storage solutions. Today they have unveiled a new line of turnkey workstation computers pre-configured with the syGlass virtual reality-based scientific data visualization and annotation toolset.
The founders of IstoVisio created syGlass in 2016 as a tool to enhance the way scientists visualize their data, much of which is microscopic and very complex. syGlass allows viewers to explore and quantify volumetric data from microscopes and other imaging devices in virtual reality via head-mounted displays like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. The partnership between IstoVisio and Pogo Linux will ensure scientists are equipped with systems built for the challenges of cutting-edge visualization and analysis.

“Our initial customers were eager to get syGlass set up in their labs, but would purchase off-the-shelf computers that could not provide adequate support or functionality,” said IstoVisio co-founder and CEO Michael Morehead. “Our own research lab previously used a Pogo Linux computer for high-end computation, and we were really pleased with the quality of the machine and the excellent support Pogo provided.”
“When our customers needed a solid hardware solution to run syGlass, Pogo Linux immediately came to mind,” Morehead said. “This partnership will provide scientists interested in using syGlass with a streamlined computing solution specific to syGlass, rather than leaving them to guess at technical specs.”

“One of our chief objectives at Pogo Linux is to make the setup of a new system effortless for our clients” said Erik Logan, CEO, Pogo Linux. “We are excited to meld this hardware methodology with the syGlass VR application for a terrific user experience, right out of the box.”
In addition to Morehead, IstoVisio co-founders include Dr. George Spirou, a neuroscientist, and Dr. Gianfranco Doretto, a computer scientist, both faculty at West Virginia University. The company operates out of Morgantown, WV.
Founded in 1999, Pogo Linux Corp. is an open-source systems integrator headquartered in Redmond, WA. With a multi-OS focus and in-house technical expertise, product offerings include a wide range of servers, workstations, and storage solutions, serving the technology needs of organizations large and small.

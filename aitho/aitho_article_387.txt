The article notes that virtually all crypto communities prefer a grassroots approach to growth and building awareness, but the truth is the more mainstream a crypto becomes, the more it can accomplish. Therefore, achieving mainstream attention would aid SmartCash and other cryptos in making a more significant global impact. The current challenge, which SmartCash is poised to resolve, is that the concept and usage of cryptos is still confusing and foreign to much of the world’s population.
SmartCash intends to solve this perplexing issue by becoming the world’s most user-friendly crypto. For example, SmartCash lets users send SMART to Web Wallet usernames, rather than only offering the lengthy, overwhelming addresses that Bitcoin (Crypto: BTC) and other cryptos are known for. This eliminates the double checking and paranoia associated with sending funds to an unknown, uninviting address that virtually must be copy and pasted to ensure complete accuracy. This way, SmartCash is more accessible to everyone, regardless of how much they understand about blockchain technology.

The ability to send crypto with a custom username is just one of the many ways that SmartCash has made mainstream adoption more feasible. Another example is its send-to-email feature, which makes it easy to get more people involved. With this unique feature, the only initial requirement for a person or business to get SMART is to have an email address. Of course, by receiving SMART via email, people will be prompted to take a few seconds to set up a SmartCash wallet to store these funds. If they don’t, the funds simply get returned to the original sender in 7 days.
The article concludes that SmartCash and its innovative approach to educating the market through user-friendly features will make inviting newcomers to crypto easier than ever before.

BigPanda Inc. announces key business momentum, significant customer adoption, and the addition of a new Chief Revenue Officer.
BigPanda Inc. has announced key business momentum highlights, significant customer adoption milestones, and the additions of Bryan Dell as Chief Revenue Officer and Steven Walske as an independent Board Member. The company achieved a 751 percent increase in total bookings during the past fifteen months, closed several multi-million dollar contracts with large enterprises, and completed global customer implementations across five continents.
BigPanda Achieves New Customer Momentum
Over the previous 15 months, major enterprises across industries including technology, airlines, retail, eCommerce, gaming and media have adopted the BigPanda Platform as a strategic enabler of their digital transformation initiatives. These companies have standardized on BigPanda as their global IT incident management solution for 24×7 coverage across geographically dispersed IT Operations.
Customer milestones during the period include:
When switching to BigPanda, enterprise customers retired legacy Event Correlation and Analysis systems including: Micro Focus Operations Manager i (previously HP OMi); IBM Tivoli Netcool; BMC Event Manager, BMC PATROL and ProactiveNet Performance Management.
Customers averaged greater than 95 percent correlation rates on their alert volumes – reducing millions of IT events down to a reasonably managed number – using intelligent IT automation based on BigPanda’s unique Open Box Machine Learning technology.
Customers on average achieved more than 50 percent reduction in mean-time-to-resolution of IT incidents to hit aggressive IT Service Level Agreements guaranteeing high availability.
BigPanda customers realized rapid initial and ongoing time-to-value. For example, one of the world’s largest media, sports and entertainment companies went live in only ten weeks, in time for the NBA season.

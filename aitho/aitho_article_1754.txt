Seeing Machines, an industry leader in computer vision technologies which enable machines to see, understand and assist people, announces that it has delivered its camera-based Driver Monitoring System (DMS) technology to Autoliv, a leader in Automotive Safety Systems, for their Learning Intelligent Vehicle (LIV) 2.0 research vehicles being showcased at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show.
Further to the recently announced collaboration between Seeing Machines and Autoliv, the companies have worked together to integrate Seeing Machines’ market leading DMS technology, based on its FOVIO driver monitoring platform, into Autoliv’s LIV2.0 vehicles to enhance Autoliv’s existing ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) offering to include awareness of the driver attention state and other key safety indicators, such as distraction or drowsiness.
The Seeing Machines technology, which generates highly robust and real-time head, face, eyelid and precision eye gaze tracking signals, allows for reliable understanding of driver state and enables Autoliv’s development of highly autonomous driving functions, with safe hands-off-wheel operation. Within the collaboration, Autoliv will serve as a Tier 1 integrator of Seeing Machines technology, and overall system supplier to OEMs.

Cryptocurrency is stored on exchange wallets, not in the terminal. The terminal doesn’t use the withdraw function, so there is no access to the input and output of funds from the user’s balance. When a stock exchange account is connected to the terminal the user creates an API key and independently determines the list of permissions transferred to the terminal.
In June 2018 ROBO-tokens will be listed at WEX, YObit, Exrates and other world cryptoexchanges.
Cryptorobotics advisors include Oliver Prock (Austria), Jean-Michel Billaut (France), Anatoli Ille (Germany), Ron Ribitzky, Will Bryant (USA). In the last month alone the terminal was presented at ICO 2018 and Consensus in New York, Blockchain Expo in London, BlockChain Summit in Frankfurt and other international forums and conferences. The project’s roadmap is outlined until 2020.

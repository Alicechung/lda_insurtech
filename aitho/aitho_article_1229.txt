rtificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Chatbot technologies are changing the way work gets done with many industries across geographies adopting these technologies into their everyday work to improve productivity.
Where does this leave the Research industry?
Surveys moved from offline to online with the introduction of web surveys. Although innovative at the time, this methodology has not really changed in the last 2 decades. This gives us a pretty good understanding on why survey response rates have also remained at 5-10% mark.
Research companies across the globe are starting to look at new and innovative ways to keep their respondents engaged in their surveys and chatbots are looking to bridge this gap by changing the way surveys are taken by introducing a conversational approach to surveys.
More than a back and forth of questions, these chatbots can share a multitude of information and messages with the survey respondents, giving research firms the ability to build contextual conversation with every survey.

Existing players in the survey tool space such as surveymonkey have started offering chatbots as a solution to deliver their surveys, albeit in a very simple format. Other chatbot companies such as surveybot.io, claim to have 800+ customers who are leveraging their online conversational solution. Built for research surveying needs, AceBot.ai lists some of the larger Research firms as its customers having handled over a million conversations through their Chatbot-led survey tool.
“Our customers are seeing a huge jump in survey response rates of up to 85%, this has helped them in attaining their previously difficult sample goals faster than their older methodologies,” says Ralph Vaz, Co-Founder of AceBot.ai

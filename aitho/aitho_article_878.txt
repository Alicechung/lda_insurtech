Bublar Believes It Will Be The First Mobile Sport-Game Using The New ARKit Motion Tracking Technology
Bublar, a publicly listed Augmented Reality gaming studio, invites to closed beta testing of a new mobile boxing game. Glowing Gloves is a first-person immersive boxing game allowing users to control, punch, bob and weave their success through the motion tracking of the mobile device. Bublar believes it will be the first mobile sport-game using the new ARKit motion tracking technology.
Available exclusively for iOS devices, the game utilises the best combos from ARKit, where users control the game with body movements and compete against others on the world stage.

“We’ve created a new control experience unseen in any mobile game. Start your career at Franky’s authentic gym and experience the highs and lows of a boxing career. Play against your friends but choose wisely, since each opponent will differ, testing your skill and fitness levels” says Wictor Hattenbach, Game Studio Director at Bublar. “With Glowing Gloves, we’re showing how Augmented Reality can create a brand new player-vs-player experience in mobile gaming. In this case, by placing your opponent right in front using real-time motion tracking,” says Magnus Granqvist, Bublar’s CEO.
Warming up? There’s more: Reflect on your trophy cabinet before choosing your next bout, experience detailed and compelling locations, practice your glowing combos and become the undisputed champion.

Cogito Ai Day: Artificial Intelligence For Business And Everyday Life With Less Hype, More Benefits

31 Oct 2017

Expert System hosted the first Cogito AI Day, a conference dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and its use in business. Industry leaders including Intesa Sanpaolo, Lloyd’s of London and Forrester were among the participants.
Earlier this year, Forbes included Expert System in the list of companies forging the next generation of Artificial Intelligence systems. “The impact of AI in the near future will be even more decisive,” said Stefano Spaggiari, CEO, Expert System. “Artificial Intelligence allows companies to overcome the purely ‘numerical’ management of data by adding the ability to understand and manage information in a way that captures the maximum business value.”
Keynote speaker Boris Evelson, VP and Principal Analyst, Forrester Research, noted that one of the most important macro-applications of Artificial Intelligence in the business world is for understanding and making use of the incredible volumes of information that companies already collect. In fact, the current rate of growth in the adoption of AI technologies is comparable to a ‘tsunami’. The number of companies implementing such technologies has grown 27% from 2016 to 2017. This is with the knowledge by users that “certain tasks are suitable for human beings, not machines.”
“It’s important to understand the potential of Artificial Intelligence from the right perspective, and to dispel the false myths and apocalyptic scenarios to which the technology is often linked,” commented Marco Varone, President & CTO, Expert System Group. “Human intelligence remains central, but there are many knowledge management problems that, thanks to AI, can already be resolved effectively, and it will solve many others as the technologies mature and improve.”

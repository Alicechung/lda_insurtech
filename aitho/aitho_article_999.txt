Upland Software, Inc.

“Two thirds of TSIA’s professional services members say improving KM could improve consultant productivity by 20% or more,” explains John Ragsdale, Distinguished VP, Service Technology Research at TSIA. “So far, there have not been any products targeting KM for professional services – until now. Upland Software is clearly a pioneer in bringing KM to PSA. I’ve known both of Upland’s products for years; they are both leaders in their field. Coming together with a unified solution for the PSA community demonstrates Upland’s leadership in the market.”
“As the professional services industry evolves, there is a growing trend to deliver fixed-bid, repeatable projects, which comprise 51%* of all PSA projects,” says Kevin Sequeira, Senior Vice President, Product Management at Upland Software. “Bringing together these two best-of-breed applications is a significant step forward in helping organizations increase operational efficiency, and thereby profits.”

While Keyword Spotting identifies pre-determined keywords and phrases within call transcriptions, CallRail’s first-to-market Call Highlights feature detects and proactively recommends new keywords to analyze, providing extra insight from a given phone conversation.
Based on these recommendations, CallRail users can adjust their Keyword Spotting settings to include these additional keywords for future analyses. Marketers can also export, report and push insights from Call Highlights into apps or sites for improved analytics.

Kevin Mann, CPO and Co-Founder, CallRail
Kevin Mann, Chief Product Officer and Co-Founder at CallRail, said, “These days, marketers can’t afford to waste their ad dollars, and CallRail is continuing to develop products that help prioritize what’s driving real results. Call Highlights can reveal unique customer insights that marketers might have otherwise missed and use them to shape future marketing initiatives that will truly resonate with their target audiences.”
Within few minutes of each phone call, users are provided with a full email report of a given conversation that includes any new keywords recommended by Call Highlights.
Additionally, CallRail has improved transcriptions in email notifications — emails will now display transcriptions for the longest customer response in a conversation, which is most often when a customer explains his or her reason for calling.
Kevin added, “Our Keyword Spotting technology provides marketers with powerful insights, but Call Highlights clues them in on the full story.”
Further, Kevin explained, “With Call Highlights, we’re bringing those really hidden call insights to life to help marketers better determine why customers are picking up the phone. Armed with these insights, CallRail users can inform a more personalized customer experience and create more relevant campaigns.”
CallRail’s Call Highlights follows several other product releases made in the past year. In June, International Numbers expanded CallRail’s call tracking services to Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, New Zealand and the U.K. In December, CallRail launched its deep integration with Facebook’s Offline Conversion API, allowing users to view calls, texts and form completions driven by Facebook ads natively in Facebook Ads Manager, alongside existing impressions and clicks.
Currently, CallRail provides call tracking and analytics to more than 75,000 companies and marketing agencies globally. CallRail’s intuitive software helps data-driven marketers optimize the performance of their advertising campaigns, increase sales effectiveness, and improve customer retention. From call tracking, routing, recording, and analytics, CallRail provides valuable data about your leads and customers to help grow your business.

BlueData Certified in New Testing Program for Running Hortonworks on Docker Containers
BlueData, provider of the leading Big-Data-as-a-Service (BDaaS) software platform, today announced further collaboration with Hortonworks and validation through the Hortonworks QATS (Quality Assured Testing Suite) program for deploying Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) in a containerized environment. This new development extends the company’s long-established relationship with Hortonworks and updates BlueData’s prior HDP certification. BlueData customers can now ensure compatibility and interoperability when running HDP on BlueData’s EPIC software — whether on-premises, in a private cloud, in the public cloud, or in a hybrid architecture.
Enterprises across every industry and geography are using Artificial Intelligence and Big Data to drive digital transformation. With BlueData, the data science teams at these organizations can quickly spin up containerized HDP clusters as well as other workloads for analytics and machine learning — enabling faster time-to-insights and faster time-to-value for business innovation. And they can reduce total cost of ownership for their data infrastructure, while ensuring enterprise-grade security and performance.

The QATS certification included dedicated Hortonworks engineering resources to continuously and thoroughly test multiple releases of HDP on the BlueData EPIC platform, validating a comprehensive suite of use cases at high performance levels under rigorous loads. BlueData is the first Big-Data-as-a-Service solution certified through the QATS program – providing Hortonworks customers with on-demand elasticity for HDP workloads in a secure multi-tenant architecture using Docker containers.

“We’ve seen rapidly growing interest in running HDP on containers, therefore it was key that we work closely with BlueData to benefit those users,” said Scott Andress, vice president of global channels & alliances at Hortonworks. “They passed our most rigorous QATS certification tests, validating that BlueData provides complete interoperability and high performance for customers running HDP in containerized environments.”

This announcement deepens BlueData’s existing partnership with Hortonworks: BlueData joined the Hortonworks partner program and achieved HDP certification for BlueData EPIC in 2014, and later introduced integration with Apache Ambari for HDP in 2015. BlueData EPIC includes pre-integrated Docker container images for recent versions of HDP and Ambari, which can then be installed via one-click deployment. BlueData has also added out-of-the-box REST API integration for other Hortonworks-developed open source technologies powered by Apache Atlas, Apache Ranger, Apache NiFi, as well as Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF).
The QATS program is Hortonworks’ highest certification level, with rigorous testing across the full breadth of HDP services; BlueData will continue to run QATS tests against future product versions. As part of this program, BlueData’s EPIC software platform passed more than one thousand tests spanning many of the most popular open source Big Data projects: including HDFS, Hive, Spark with LLAP, Ranger, and Atlas. The tests covered all 23 functional dependency points for HDP and BlueData’s pass rate was 100%.

This new certification enables Hortonworks and BlueData to provide best-in-class support for their customers’ existing and future investments in HDP. BlueData and Hortonworks will also collaborate on go-to-market plans, sales enablement, and engineering R&D to ensure continuous product compatibility along with the high-quality customer service.
“We’ve been working with Hortonworks since we first launched BlueData, and our customers have seen the value and benefits of that collaboration,” said Kumar Sreekanti, co-founder and CEO at BlueData. “We’re excited to build upon that partnership through this new testing program, ensuring the most secure and high-performance solution in the industry for running HDP and other data-intensive workloads in a containerized environment.”

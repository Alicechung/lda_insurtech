06 Feb 2018

HAZON Solutions (“HAZON”), the national leader in drone inspection services, announced today the opening of a second office. The newly organized South West Region will be headquartered in Austin, TX, and represents the first outpost for HAZON that will decrease lead times and costs for clients west of the Mississippi River.
HAZON’s new outpost in Texas will enable expanded reach and decreased lead times and costs for clients west of the Mississippi.
“We are extremely excited about opening our first regional office,” said HAZON CEO and co-founder retired U.S. Navy Capt. David A. Culler Jr. “Today represents an enormous milestone for HAZON and for our clients. We’ve serviced all work out of our Virginia location up till now. This will increase our reach across the country and ensure we’re able to better meet our client’s needs.”
This milestone represents a significant movement for HAZON, known for offering critical infrastructure inspections nationwide. In a recently published case study, HAZON articulated a 40% higher detection rate of areas of concern in transmission line inspections. The energy sector will be a key market for HAZON moving forward.
“I couldn’t be more thrilled to be bringing HAZON to Texas,” said HAZON Vice President Ed Hine.  “HAZON is the clear leader in infrastructure inspection. By opening this office we’ll be filling a void in the southwest region by providing best in class unmanned inspection services.”
“We’ve been growing rapidly for the past two years, a regional expansion plan was a natural move for us,” said Culler. “While this is a great day, we’re not certainly not slowing down to smell the roses, we’re continuously looking forward to our next growth opportunity.”

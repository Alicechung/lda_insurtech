“We are an Artificial Intelligence software solutions company; our first product is an autonomous driving software suite,” said CEO Mike McQuary. “All of our hiring and R&D work in the last two years has been in AI software development. While our electric vehicle experience is part of our DNA and gives us a great advantage in developing automotive grade solutions, it is time that our name better reflects our focus and skillsets. We chose ‘Autonomous’ because our first AI product is an autonomous driving solution, and ‘Fusion’ because our proprietary Deep Learning software uses a fusion of behavioral cloning and automatic semantic annotation information. The result is a more efficient and unified Deep Learning architecture.”
Autonomous Fusion will remain headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. “We enjoy a close relationship with the technical colleges and universities nearby, and have access to a growing technical talent base,” said Mike McQuary. “We have hired some of the brightest minds in AI and Machine Learning, and together they have built a proprietary AI platform and set of autonomous driving tools. We have been testing in laboratory simulations and on the roads of Atlanta for nearly a year. Autonomous Driving needs to be built on the cornerstones of safety and control in order to be successful. It should make driving more safe and not give the driver additional anxiety of fear of loss of control.”

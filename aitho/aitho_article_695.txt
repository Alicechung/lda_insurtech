Precise builds on its jury research capabilities by offering AI and machine learning app for litigators.
Precise Inc., a trusted provider of litigation technology services, today announced a reseller agreement with Voltaire, Inc., a Telluride, Colorado-based legal technology company. The Voltaire platform provides attorneys with unparalleled research and insight into their jury pool prior to selection while ensuring compliance with ethics regulations and maintaining juror privacy.
Precise Advisory, LLC, a subsidiary of Precise, Inc., will now offer the Voltaire Voir Dire app. The Voltaire app, powered by IBM Watson, conducts exhaustive research on jury pool participants by searching publicly available records, transactions, registrations, and social media footprints. The application will complement the jury research capabilities already offered through Precise Advisory, LLC.

“We were initially attracted to Voltaire because their mission is very much in line with ours. Both firms strive to level the playing field for attorneys going to trial,” explains Paul Null, president of Precise Advisory. “Many attorneys believe, rightfully so, that cases can be won or lost during jury selection. Voltaire gives attorneys a competitive edge in the courtroom by arming them with insightful information and a more complete picture of the individuals that are being chosen to determine the outcome of their case.”
“Precise is well-suited to add Voltaire to their suite of technology solutions,” said Michael Miceli, Voltaire’s chief marketing officer. “The high caliber of our technology combined with the expertise of Precise’s trial consultants offers a remarkable asset to the attorney during the critical jury selection phase of a trial.”

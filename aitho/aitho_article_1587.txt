01 Feb 2018

These Campaigns Ranged In Size From 2 Million Raised To Over 164 Million Raised
Foxtail Marketing, a tech and cryptocurrency focused marketing agency located in the silicon slopes of Utah, announced that they have put the finishing touches on their last ICO campaigns that launched in 2017. This brought their total successful ICO campaigns to 42 for the year. These campaigns ranged in size from 2 Million raised to over 164 Million raised.
Foxtail has been around for five years, but they got started in the cryptocurrency industry about two years ago when they began working with Dash, now the 12th largest cryptocurrency according to CoinMarketCap. After working with them on their branding and launch strategies, Foxtail began working with groups looking to raise funds through the ICO (initial coin offering) vehicle. This led them to work with over 50 clients in the year 2017 and successfully hit funding goals for 42 of those clients.
Foxtail focuses on trust building, community engagement, PR, social promotion, paid promotion, and email marketing for their cryptocurrency clients. They also work with their clients after they have launched and closed their ICOs. The ongoing relationships help their clients with getting listed on exchanges and increasing the awareness of their currencies.
Foxtail has plans to beat their record in 2018, but they aren’t opening the floodgates on growth. Instead, they are still picking and choosing the clients and projects that will work best with their strategies. Thus, the amount raised should increase, but they don’t anticipate taking on more than 50 new clients in 2018. This will allow them to keep their boutique agency feel and give concierge-level service to all of their clients.

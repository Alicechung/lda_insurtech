Evolve Health, the world’s fastest calorie tracking app and automated health advisor, has launched a new mobile app that helps users stay on top of their health and track their calories with an artificially intelligent health advisor named Eva. The Evolve Health App, now available for free download on iOS devices, provides users with the fastest way to track their calories and nutrients.

Through the app, members can simply tap a button, say what they ate, and then Evolve’s artificially intelligent health advisor Ēva, uses natural language processing to detect what foods users are saying, and then dynamically records it all. What used to take two minutes or more to track your diet, can now be accomplished in under 10 seconds.
“When you want to start on a path to a healthier place, a common obstacle is how time consuming it is to keep track of your health and staying motivated,” said Stephen Mata, co-founder & CEO of Evolve Fitness. “While developing Evolve, our goal was to create a platform that not only saved you time, but also made it simple to live a healthy lifestyle.”

The Evolve App recently debuted it’s beta on the Apple Music original series, “Planet Of The Apps”  where they selected Jessica Alba as a celebrity advisor during their time on the show. On each episode of Planet of the Apps, app makers have 60 seconds to pitch their idea in front of celebrity judges Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Will.i.am and Gary Vaynerchuk on a slow-moving escalator — for a visual idea of an ‘elevator pitch.’

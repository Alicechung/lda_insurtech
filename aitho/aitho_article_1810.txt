New capabilities revolutionize how construction companies plan, bid and manage their earthworks projects
Kespry, the leading aerial intelligence platform provider, has announced the availability of a suite of capabilities that extends the value of aerial intelligence to the full life cycle of planning, bidding and managing earthworks projects in the major site construction industry. New capabilities include grade planning and analysis, site and surface comparison including cut/fill visualization, and design plan development and compliance.
“The construction industry needs more than just one-off drone mapping of their earthworks sites,” said George Mathew, CEO and chairman of Kespry. “The addition of these earthworks-specific aerial intelligence tools will enable construction companies to plan their work more accurately, improve their cost structure, and deliver safer working environments through frequent analysis of changes to their site. This will truly transform the way work is done in this industry.”
Implementation of these new capabilities is a direct result of customer and partner feedback, including from John Deere, their dealers and their clients.
“Aerial intelligence is changing how large scale construction projects are done,” said Andrew Kahler, product marketing manager, John Deere Worksight™. Kespry is delivering the analysis, insight and tools that project managers need to ensure their earthworks projects are completed on time, as cost efficiently as possible and more safely than ever before.”

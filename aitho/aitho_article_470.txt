CareThrough, a HealthChannels Company, Teams With Chatbot Technology Provider LifeLink To Provide High-Touch Personalized Patient Navigation Services At Scale Across Healthcare
Leading healthcare service provider CareThrough, a subsidiary of HealthChannels, announced it has partnered with technology provider LifeLink to radically improve the level of outreach, engagement, and care for patients through the use of smart, mobile phone-based chatbot technology. As mobile technology throughout sectors continues to grow with the increasing use of smartphones and chat, the CareThrough and LifeLink partnership translate the trend into life-saving technology.
LifeLink’s advanced conversational patient engagement platform gives patients care-related concierge services via mobile phone-based messaging. Chatbots, never on hold and infinitely scalable, augment the vital communication between patients and their care teams and improve responsiveness and service. Emergency room wait times, appointment reminders, directions to the healthcare facility, medication compliance and post-op care plans are all personalized and automated.

“Our clients are looking for smart technology to serve a range of populations, from the 75-year-old patient to the millennial, across the care continuum,” says CareThrough President Kyle Cooksey. “The common denominator is that they all rely on and use mobile phone-based messaging and chat. The technology is transformative, especially in the Emergency Department,” says Cooksey. “Chatbots transform our navigators’ ability to reduce patient anxiety and steer them in the right direction, towards the next point of care.”
The full potential of LifeLink’s technology is realized when combined with CareThrough navigators. The conversational platform is used in the ED by specialized navigators, freeing physicians and care teams to work top-of-license to deliver high-quality clinical care. Chatbots activate the patient experience, handle a range of intake and questionnaire-related tasks, and navigators provide the human connection allowing health systems to connect patients with the right resources quickly and consistently every time. This combination of advanced mobile technology and specialized human services optimize patient engagement before, during, and after visits.

“Pairing mobile technology with care navigators helps providers achieve value-based care goals in this new era of the digitally-connected consumer,” says Dr. Michael Murphy, CEO of HealthChannels. “Research shows a full 64% of consumers want to reach the businesses they deal with via mobile messaging, and yet health systems have engaged just 2% of their patients with mobile apps. It’s a big disconnect. Our partnership with LifeLink ensures providers can jump the curve to high-quality patient engagement and outcomes at scale.”
It’s estimated that disengaged patients cost $33 billion a year in avoidable hospital admittances, higher treatment costs, low prescription adherence and preventable deaths. As health systems try and remedy this with mobile apps, they’re proving unsuccessful as data shows that consumers stick to five apps, and often delete others. Meantime, consumers are spending an estimated 2.5 hours per day, over half of their overall time, using messaging-based chat apps and texting on their mobile phones.
LifeLink’s technology platform is intuitive and responsive,” says LifeLink CEO Greg Johnsen. “Consumers have app fatigue and printed information packs are overwhelming and ineffective. Our advanced mobile messaging technology paired with CareThrough navigators streamline engagement, improve service, and rein in costs at scale.”

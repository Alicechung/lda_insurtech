08 Feb 2018

Founded in 2016, Mirra is a design tool that allows anyone to create and publish professional quality AR and VR experiences – without 3D expertise and without code. Available starting today, the Mirra AR app for iOS lets you view and explore the incredible augmented reality and virtual reality experiences created with Mirra.
“With our new AR app, you can see experiences as if they were right in front of you or you might choose to immerse yourself in the content”

“With our new AR app, you can see experiences as if they were right in front of you or you might choose to immerse yourself in the content,” said Kevin Farnham, CEO of Mirra. “Even experiences intended for VR are viewable without the need for a headset.”
You can view experiences in Diorama Mode, where creations appear on a tabletop or on the floor; in Immersive Mode, where the experience surrounds you; or in Content-Only mode, where only the items added to experiences appear around you.
Creating experiences with the Mirra Web-based editor couldn’t be easier – you’re able to drag and drop images, video, audio, 360 media, and 3D models right into your scene. You can add interactivity and text in more than 500 languages.
Experiences are cloud-hosted and are instantly shareable in AR, VR and even the desktop. This platform-agnostic approach is designed to lower the barrier for content creation in 3D environments and accelerate the mass adoption of Immersive Experiences.
“People use Mirra for everything: presentations, product tours, sales tools, education and training, portfolios, location tours, brand and promotional experiences, galleries, AR/VR prototyping, or just for fun,” said Kevin Farnham. “What’s amazing about our platform is that you can design an XR experience in the same amount of time and effort it takes to make a Powerpoint presentation.”

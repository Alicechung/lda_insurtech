“Our technology is based on over 20 man-years of development and is deployed in over 100 countries,” said Dr. Douglas Bakkum, Co-founder and CEO at Shift, “As a result of our in-depth experience, we are able to create customized, high-security solutions for crypto exchanges that secures their most important asset – their clients’ trust.”
With the alarming increase in security breaches at online crypto exchanges resulting in over a billion dollars in theft, it has become a foregone conclusion that only hardware isolation of private keys in the possession of the owner or custodian can protect professional investors and consumers from online theft.
BitBox Basecamp provides maximum protection for online cryptocurrency transactions via five security pillars: physical isolation of private keys from the internet, advanced cryptographic security algorithms, state-of-the-art encryption and anti-phishing technology, second factor authentication (2FA), and multisignature support.

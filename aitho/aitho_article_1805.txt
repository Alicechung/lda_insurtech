POS Solutions Provider to Launch on Blockchain to Benefit Merchants and Consumers
Pundi X, a cryptocurrency point-of-sale (“POS”) solutions provider for retail stores seeking to accept digital currencies in South East Asia, today announced their successful integration into the NEM blockchain. With the new change, every Pundi X POS device can be connected to both the Ethereum and NEM blockchains, enabling consumers to easily buy or sell cryptocurrencies (BTS, ETH, XEM, LTC, PXS tokens) using fiat money (Dollars, Rupiah, Baht, etc.), bank card, mobile wallet or with a Pundi X Pass.
XEM is the world’s tenth largest cryptocurrency, according to coinmarketcap.com, with a market capitalization of US $1.6 billion. NEM’s technology is currently employed by a variety of financial institutions and industries. When considering demand and trade volume, NEM also boasts being one of the most popular altcoins in Japan.

“By using NEM’s blockchain solution, we can confirm transactions instantly, which enables us to lower the exchange risk and provide a better user experience,” said Zac Cheah, CEO of Pundi X. “Moreover, Pundi X can now focus on rapid expansion to new markets thanks to our inclusion in the NEM network.”
“We are working to achieve mass adoption of the NEM protocol through sovereign fiat money issuance, financial settlements, payments, trade finance, stock markets, forex and other applications. The Pundi X business matches this goal because it makes cryptocurrencies more accessible for people to use in their daily lives,” commented Lon Wong, President of NEM.io Foundation. “NEM is very easy to implement. For example, it took only one day to make the Pundi X system work on the NEM blockchain for both the private and the public chains.”

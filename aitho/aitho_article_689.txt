AppZen Integrates with CoupaLink to Bring Artificial Intelligence Automation to Travel and Expense Auditing
AppZen, the leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions for back office automation, has been named as one of the new partners in the expanding CoupaLink program, part of Coupa Software, a leader in business spend management. CoupaLink allows technology partners to create software solutions that integrate seamlessly with Coupa and become certified for all Coupa customers.

“The amount of waste through inaccurate expense auditing is shocking when you look at the numbers,” said Anant Kale, CEO AppZen. “Our larger customers who turn over thousands of expenses every day, are saving more than $200,000 of T&E spend in just 6 weeks on our system. The numbers do the talking. We are delighted to leverage Coupa’s network so more audit teams can realize the benefits intelligent AI brings in transforming the T&E process.”
Expense auditing remains an outdated manual process that results in a fraction of expenses getting paid out with proper auditing due to time and cost pressures of staff. Today’s strict regulatory environment is also leaving enterprises exposed to noncompliance. AppZen’s proprietary AI platform combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision and Machine Learning to analyze thousands of internal and external data sources, government databases and company policies, identifying misuse, fraud and non-compliance, so auditors can focus time and efforts on only the high-risk expenses that need their attention.

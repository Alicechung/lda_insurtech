Countries around the world are looking to excel in the Blockchain space.  Dubai, Russia, America, and other countries want to be in the fast lane of this wave of integrity-based trade.  Export Portal CEO Ms. Ally Spinu is attending the event with the intention of opening discussions with the government administrators, SME, and supply chain leaders in the e-Commerce and Blockchain space.  There are no restrictions as to how much international import-export trade can be transacted in this digital age.
Ms. Spinu stated, “Export Portal has moved beyond the proof of concept phase and is ready for our next expansion phase.  Russia, South East Asia, or the Middle East will be where the next intellectual, technological, and blockchain trade war will be won.”

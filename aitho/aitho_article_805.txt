Datametrex AI Limited (the “Company” or “Datametrex”) (TSXV:DM) (FSE:D4G) is pleased to announce that its wholly owned subsidiary, Ronin Blockchain Corp., has begun mining a combination of alt coins such as Zcash, Zcoin and Monero as well as Ethereum in both its Quebec and China locations. Ronin looks to maximize its 150 MW capacity in China and is also in discussion with a number of industry strategic partners that see the value in this massive footprint.
“The China jurisdiction along with the support from our partner GoSun has tremendous advantages and economies of scale. This footprint is one of the largest in the cryptocurrency mining sector today and should give Ronin key advantages,” says Michael Frank, CEO of Ronin Blockchain.

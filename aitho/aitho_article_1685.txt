Marketing and advertising technology industry veterans today announced the launch of MathCapital, a predominantly early-stage venture capital fund that will support the next generation of marketing and advertising technology leaders. Joe Zawadzki, CEO and founder of MediaMath, and Eric Franchi, co-founder and formerly of Undertone, will serve as Partners of the fund.
Marketing expenditures exceed $1.5 trillion annually. Digital Marketing currently represents $230B in spend, and is growing.  Consumers increasingly spend time, consume content and make decisions via digital devices (20.4Bconnected “things” will be in use worldwide by 2020). Companies that can connect these consumers to the products and services they desire are creating tremendous value, and those that can harness the power of digital distribution to generate real business outcomes for marketers are poised to reinvent the practice of marketing. MathCapital’s mission is to fund and support the entrepreneurs and companies that are driving this digital transformation.

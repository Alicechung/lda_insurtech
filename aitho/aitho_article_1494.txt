Vijitha Kaduwela, Founder & CEO of Kavi Global, observes “Advana helps enterprises seriously considering machine learning to overcome adoption barriers like time and cost. Advana makes it possible with near-zero training for their analytics teams to adopt newer and preferred machine learning technologies like Apache Spark. Since it eliminates the need to do coding, Advana empowers the creation of more citizen data scientists. With our 14 day free trial on Advana.Live, we are looking at increasing the outreach by adding more users, through the easy-to-use S-a-a-S edition”
Equipped with the latest Spark Machine Libraries, Advana is ideal for citizen data scientists through its:
Simple, menu-driven, drag&drop interface
Register & Start Using (No install/configuration)
Visual Pipelining and Model tuning
Auto integration of updates: never gets out-dated
Analytics teams currently leverage Advana to solve use cases like Campaign lead generation, Targeted price setting, Customer Segmentation, Customer churn analysis, Credit risk analysis, Product recommendation, Asset Maintenance and Reliability Analysis, Fraud Waste and Abuse Prevention, etc.,

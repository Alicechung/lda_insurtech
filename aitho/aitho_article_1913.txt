The Summer ’17 Release enables enterprises to unlock more value from their customer, partner and supplier relationships
Pramata, the leading commercial relationship operations company, today announced its Summer ’17 Release which features a new suite of applications that leverage machine learning and built-in analytics to gain valuable new insights from customer, partner and supplier data. By combining a software platform and human-assisted artificial intelligence (AI), Pramata customers can now quickly operationalize commercial relationship data and deliver it to sales, legal, and finance teams to maximize revenue, compliance, and operational efficiencies. In addition, new visualization capabilities and dashboards bring the data to life in a way that highlights new revenue moments, and is easily shared and pushed across teams and business functions.
“The first company to create a solution that scales and enforces contracts compliance with artificial intelligence is going to revolutionize post sales commercial relationships the same way the Sales Force Automation Platform vendors revolutionized lead and funnel management,” said Dana Therrien, Research Director, Sales Operations Strategies at SiriusDecisions.
“The magic of Pramata is that they give me the data I need, pulled from my customer contracts and systems across my business, to drive revenue and reduce risk,” said Dan Carr, Vice President of Sales Operations, Comcast Business. “The new dashboard and visualization features in the Summer ’17 release will help us move even faster and gain even more customer value.”
“Most software products give you tools and then ask you and your teams to do all the work populating the tools with your data,” said Justin Schweisberger, Pramata’s Chief Product Officer. “Pramata is the only business application that combines the software platform, analytics and normalized customer data to make an immediate business impact and capture each revenue moment. The addition of human-assisted AI ensures customer data is always complete, accurate and up-to-date, and our new applications solve targeted business problems resulting from gaps in the customer lifecycle.”

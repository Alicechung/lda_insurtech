“Since the platform public Beta launched at Women in Blockchain last February in New York, we have received overwhelming support, feedback and feature requests from the community”, says Tongtong Gong, co-founder of Amberdata. “We are thrilled to announce the GA release at EDCON, the Community Ethereum Development Conference.”
Shawn Douglass, CEO of Amberdata, added: “There was no enterprise grade solution for operational insights, application performance monitoring, infrastructure visibility or search. The Splunk, AppDynamics or New Relic for blockchain had not been built. Having run software business at scale, we knew everyone would need transparency into the state and health of blockchain infrastructure, applications and transactions. This is not nice to have, but rather a required piece in the ecosystem for anyone to adopt blockchain.”

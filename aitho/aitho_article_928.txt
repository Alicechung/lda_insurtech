SAS GLOBAL FORUM — Siemens Healthineers, a global leader in medical technology, uses SAS’ machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to analyze urgent data generated by its systems worldwide. The data comes from a variety of devices like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) systems. SAS helps predict system problems and potential downtime several days in advance of a failure.
“Our goal is to maximize the uptime of our medical equipment at the customer site,” said Dr. Mirko Appel, Head of Analytical Services in the Customer Services organization at Siemens Healthineers. “Our analytical system receives hundreds of thousands of lines of sensor data each day, and a significant part of it is only semi-structured. Automated and scalable analytics are crucial to help us offer good decision support to our service-delivery organization and to actively drive the digitalization of healthcare. SAS helps us optimize our service processes, save spare parts and reduce troubleshooting time.”

Enterprises like Lockheed Martin, Octo Telematics and Western Digital also have selected SAS to pull insights from a sea of data created by connected devices.
“Traditionally, IoT has been associated with initiatives like the smart grid, smart cities and connected factories, but as we realize the value of analyzing sensor data, the circle of involved industries grows wider,” said Jason Mann, SAS Vice President of IoT. “At its essence, Siemens Healthineers uses powerful analytics to help clinical settings remain more productive.”
Mann added that SAS’ IoT division will continue to focus on diverse industries including manufacturing, health care, government and insurance.

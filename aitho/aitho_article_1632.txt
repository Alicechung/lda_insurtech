In The Era Of Symbiosism Economy, Users And Businesses Can Achieve Common Development And Prosperity
Symbiosism Economy is a new economic era and business model that powered by advanced blockchain technology and cryptocurrency (encrypted digital currency). It provides an unprecedented solution to an important issue: how to connect users and businesses more closely to form a business community.
Most global giants like Google started from very small companies and a large number of enthusiastic and far-sighted users had participated at the early stage of their products by help promoting and developing it. Such behaviors played a crucial role to those businesses’ development and global success as a result. However, those early supporters did not receive any material rewards from helping them.
The blockchain & cryptocurrency technological innovation that initiated by Symbiosism Economy Foundation can solve the above issue perfectly. Through introducing a new business model, namely Symbiosism Economy, LivesOne can bond businesses’ development with a new cryptocurrency LivesToken. During the development process, businesses can distribute a certain proportion of LivesToken to their users to quantify and compensate the value that generated from their Internet using behaviors. In this way, users’ benefit will be closely bond with businesses’ development. And with the businesses’ user scale, revenue, and brand awareness increased, the value of LivesToken(LVT) will rise either, and the early holders of the cryptocurrency can enjoy the return of appreciation that caused by business development. On the other hand, businesses will focus more on how to meet users’ demand.

Adding to its established portfolio of world-class On Demand Packaging®solutions—also referred to as custom box-making machines and smart packaging systems—PackBot™ addresses top concerns of today’s manufacturing and fulfillment managers, such as labor shortages, throughput and reliability.
“PackBot™ is at the heart of global trends such as smart manufacturing and warehousing,” said Packsize Chief Scientist Niklas Pettersson. “Consumer preference for sustainably packaged products is driving industry focus on packaging optimization, along with manufacturers and distribution center managers who find it increasingly difficult to fulfill manual labor requirements. Through our continued emphasis on sustainable formats and automation, this platform’s patented box-erecting process is a true game-changer for On Demand Packaging® systems.”
This smart box-marking system also delivers on Packsize’s GMA’s promise of rapid machine development. Through a proprietary modular engineering approach, PackBot™ can be tailored to meet the customer’s specific requirements and made to order.

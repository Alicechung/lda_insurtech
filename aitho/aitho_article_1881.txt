ICOBox Launches “Blockchain Jumpstarter” To Fund The Next Big Blockchain Projects

29 Sep 2017

Token sales are rapidly replacing legacy methods of  providing initial financial support for promising startups, and both startup founders and backers are increasingly adopting and embracing this method of alternative funding.
“When we started ICOBox, we found that while many entrepreneurs have the resources and capital to launch a blockchain project, many others do not,” said Mike Raitsyn, co-founder of ICOBox. “There are countless entrepreneurs with compelling ideas to push the industry forward, and we feel it’s our duty as part of the blockchain community to help them by providing a platform to jumpstart their ideas.”
The purpose of ICOBox’s ICOS token sale is to attract funds to help promising but underfunded new projects bring their innovations to life by utilizing the ICOBox toolkit, which includes a suite of offerings including technological, legal, and marketing components. Startups will benefit from both the expert consultations by the ICOBox advisory team and turnkey solutions of ICOBox’s SaaS platform, while market participants will benefit from early access to the selected projects’ ICOs with significant savings on their token sale purchase prices.
The projects prescreened by ICOBox and selected by the vote of ICOS token holders will receive ICOBox tools for free, in exchange for their future tokens. ICOBox intends to help launch 800 new ICOs over the next 12 months.

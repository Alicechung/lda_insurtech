It’s perfect for sales demos, impactful marketing engagements, and hands-on tutorials. Upload 3D models, images, and videos to a web portal, then physically place them in the real world via the HoloLens. Presenters can sequence their presentations and add beautiful transitions, so their viewers can watch the virtual presentations unfold in their physical environment.
“We were building augmented reality presentations for Fortune 500 companies and seeing how effective AR presentations were; we decided to reduce the complexity and cost of creating engaging and immersive augmented reality experiences. That’s when we started AfterNow Prez.” – Philippe Lewicki, Captain at AfterNow.

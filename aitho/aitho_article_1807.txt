“The UAV industry is constantly evolving,” says David Thompson, owner of DronUcopia, “and our mission is to support that industry the best way we know how — by providing the latest models and parts at reasonable prices, alongside a promise to deliver the best customer service in the business.”
Currently, the DronUcopia inventory consists of several respected manufacturers — DJI, Team Blacksheep, Wingsland, PowerVision, and Yuneec —and needful accessories like battery packs and propellers. Those interested in drone racing or strictly commercial applications will both find vehicles to their liking at DronUcopia. Individual product pages cover the important specifications of each vehicle.
DronUcopia is also rolling out drone insurance to help pilots protect their valuable assets. Mishaps are almost inevitable, and insurance can help replace a totaled vehicle.
As drones become even more popular as a fun pastime for gadget enthusiasts who have probably not piloted such powerful vehicles, certification courses are in greater demand than ever. To that end, DronUcopia will be partnering with the top tier provider in the industry to offer training courses for all levels of pilots.
The long-term plan for Thompson and the team at DronUcopia is to assemble the internet’s biggest selection of high-quality commercial and consumer drones, plus a complete range of accessories to complement them.

ZHOME today introduced its new “Virtual Assistant” solution at select homes in its inventory of homes for sale. This valuable new tool will instantly stage and show properties to homebuyers and let them speak live with a ZHOME representative, all at the touch of a button.

“We have found that there are homebuyers who may be reluctant or just simply unable to use their smart phones to download web applications or use texting to gain access to our homes. Our new patent pending Virtual Assistant tool will enable homebuyers instant access to our homes with the touch of a button. Virtual Assistant enabled homes will then be instantly pre-staged and ready to tour by using the latest in smart home technology” said Kora Shear, Director of Sales and Acquisitions for ZHOME.

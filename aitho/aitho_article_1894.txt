The Varidesk Ar Office Planner Has First-To-Market Capabilities Like In-App Purchasing And Sizing To Scale
VARIDESK, LLC, the global leader in height-adjustable desk solutions, has released The VARIDESK Augmented Reality (AR) Office Planner app. The free app allows users to experience the full range of VARIDESK height-adjustable workspace solutions before they make a purchase.
With first-to-market capabilities like in-app purchasing and product views entirely to scale, the AR app is a completely new way to shop for the office, school or home. The app allows consumers to select a product and virtually place it on their desk to see how it looks and fits their space, in both standing and sitting positions. Shoppers can also view VARIDESK products at all angles, visualize various layouts, share with co-workers, key decision makers or family and friends, plus make their purchase, all within the app.
“Our goal has always been to create the best solution at the highest quality to help individuals and companies build active workspaces that perfectly fit their needs,” said Jason McCann, VARIDESK Chief Executive Officer. “We feel the AR app will help our fans choose the perfect VARIDESK for their space. This is just another way we are helping to simplify how active workspaces will be visualized and built going forward.”
VARIDESK AR Office Planner was developed by the team’s in-house research and development team that continues to leverage emerging technologies to make visualizing furniture in any workspace as easy and as realistic as possible.

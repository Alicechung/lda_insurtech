This agreement marks another milestone in our IIoT development. It not only grows our presence in China’sIIoT space following our agreement late last year to jointly develop an IIoT cloud platform with Shandong Province and other IIoT engagements, but also demonstrates our effectiveness and strategy to leverage our core technology competence to build highly scalable big data analytics and AI solutions that can be customized and applied in a number of different areas. Both Bee® and Gridsum share similar philosophies and visions which I believe when combined with our respective technology capabilities, will greatly benefit China’s drive to conserve energy and reduce emissions.”

Vicarious, an artificial intelligence company, today announced a $50MSeries C round of financing led by Khosla Ventures, a venture capital fund founded by Vinod Khosla, co-founder of Sun Microsystems and a former general partner of Kleiner Perkins.
Vicarious is developing artificial general intelligence for robots. By combining insights from generative probabilistic models and neuroscience, the company has developed unique architecture that trains faster, adapts more readily, and generalizes more broadly than other AI approaches that are more commonly used.
“For over a decade, robots have possessed the physical dexterity necessary for a wide range of tasks, but are limited by their reliance on expensive hand-coded software and high-precision mechanical parts. The software that Vicarious is building will help change that,” said Mr. Khosla. “Vicarious’ approach to artificial intelligence allows robots to behave in smarter and more human-like ways than other approaches,” added Khosla Venture’s CTO Sven Strohband, who will be joining Vicarious’ board of directors.
“This is a big step forward for us. Robotics is a domain where causal understanding and dealing with uncertainty are very important. Our researchers are excited to be tackling the problems that touch many industries,” said Vicarious co-founder Dr. Dileep George. “The partnership with Khosla is an obvious fit. They share our vision of the future and understand the incredible implications of building truly intelligent machines,” added Vicarious co-founder D. Scott Phoenix.

Consumers and merchants across the world will soon experience convenience in retail services and online shopping with the launch of RPAY. A platform aimed at making retail and trade easier for both businesses and buyers, RPAY empowers the global retail sector through the use of its own cryptocurrency called R Token (RTK).
The estimated revenues of the retail sector worldwide are expected to grow by 3.8 percent annually and hit US$28 trillion by 2019. This opens a big opportunity for the retail industry to progress, and the RPAY application has the features and technology that can revolutionize this market.
With cryptocurrency use at the forefront, RPAY creates an efficient payment system built on a peer-to-peer, decentralized network over blockchain technology. Its own digital currency called R Token (RTK) and other cryptocurrencies will create a global blockchain-based economy that prides on quick and hassle-free transactions.
“We want the participation process to be increasingly simpler and economical for people and we want our new economic model to spread because we believe that it will help people improve the way they use their money and the things they can buy with it. We want people to be able to “make more of their money” and “live the dream,” stated in the RPAY Whitepaper.
The use of application will introduce to all kinds of consumers the safe and simple ways to pay using crypto coins set against the R Token price wherever they may be in the world.

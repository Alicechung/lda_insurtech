Including our students as young paraprofessionals with the institution’s strong applied research culture makes Marist unique within higher education,” said Bill Thirsk, Vice President of Information Technology/CIO at Marist College.  “Having BlackRidge as a joint research and technology incubation partner further differentiates us.

“Marist College has been a tremendous cybersecurity research partner for BlackRidge, providing access to IT resources and faculty and students to collaborate on our products and solutions.  Most recently, we collaborated on providing an active cyber defense for distributed network-based applications including blockchains to protect them from unidentified and unauthorized discovery and access and from DDoS attacks.  We look forward to working with Marist to bring to market their hosted blockchain solution secured by BlackRidge,” said Bob Graham, CEO of BlackRidge Technology.

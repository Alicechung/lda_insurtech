“We want to make it easy and fun for people to turn their living room into a smart entertainment center with the Assistant,” said Michele Turner, Sr. Director, Google Smart Home Ecosystem. “By working closely with DISH, we’ll ensure that customers can easily control their TVs through the Assistant, instead of searching for or having to share the remote.”

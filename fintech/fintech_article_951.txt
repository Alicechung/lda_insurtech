The d10e team is proud to announce its event, the world’s largest on decentralization, is coming to Romania next month. This is d10e’s sixth conference and will feature a studded lineup of 40 world class presenters.
The two-day conference, which runs Feb. 21-22, focuses on the future of decentralizing technologies in financial technology with themes centered on blockchain technology, disruptive culture, the sharing economy and the future of work.

 David Orban, managing partner at Network Society Ventures, said “Decentralization is an unstoppable consequence of the exponential technologies that we see around us, implemented by passionate and creative teams all over the world.

 “For Network Society Ventures to be at d10e is to be at the center of this phase transformation in our socio-economic organization, and I am excited to be keynoting it!”

 Mike Costache, who joined the d10e team following last year’s Amsterdam conference, said attendees will be provided with insights into the overall state of decentralization, actionable knowledge and a unique cultural and educational experience with some of today’s most cutting edge areas of technology.

 “Romania may not come to anyone’s mind when thinking about the world’s most promising places for tech and startups, but it does have a flourishing start up community and is on its way to adopting decentralisation in many areas of life and business,” Costache said.

 The conference will be held at the Sheraton Hotel in Bucharest, Romania.

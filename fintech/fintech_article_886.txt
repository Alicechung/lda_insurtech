FINTECH NORTH – SHOWCASING LEEDS AS A FINTECH CAPITAL

March 24, 2017

In recent months the interest and activity in the FinTech sector in Leeds has heightened, with developments including the publication of a Council-funded report into FinTech in the Leeds City Region, the unveiling of plans for a new digital city and laboratory on the south of the city, and the plans for this year’s FinTech North event gathering pace.

 Organised by Leeds-based Whitecap Consulting and White Label Crowdfunding, FinTech North is a one day conference taking place at aql’s data centre in Leeds on 26th April during Leeds Digital Festival. The goal of the event is to generate awareness, collaboration and to share best-practice within the financial services and technology community, thereby generating tangible economic benefits for the region. Following the success of the inaugural event in 2016, FinTech North aims to attract 350 delegates and support from the FinTech community in the Leeds City Region, across the UK, and internationally. The agenda for the one day conference will feature a number of wellknown keynote speakers including the government’s Fintech Envoy for the Northern Powerhouse, the FCA, as well as FinTech gurus from as far afield as Toronto and Estonia. The speakers will cover hot topics including Artificial Intelligence, open banking, digital transformation, alternative finance, big data and analytics, and FinTech funding. Organisations to have pledged their support to the FinTech North conference include aql, BJSS, Computershare, Munroe K, FiNexus, Leeds City Region Enterprise Partnership, West Yorkshire Combined Authority, and Nostrum Group. Munroe K is a Leeds-based property investment and development company which is behind the plans to develop a digital city – ICON – on the south of the city. The project will see the current Leeds White Rose Office Park expand into a 72 acre centre for digital and technology innovation, including the ‘Y Leeds’ digital laboratory, which will be an anchor property for the new development.

Wanted: the future of financial health

March 14, 2017

Fintechs with a focus on financial health can now apply to participate in a groundbreaking incubation programme announced today by the Finance Innovation Lab and Toynbee Hall. The Financial Health Fellowship, delivered over six months in 2017, will boost strategic know-how, transform leadership skills and prepare Fellows to scale their businesses.

 Applications are invited from fintech entrepreneurs who are actively developing a financial product or service that can support financial health and has the potential to transform the wider financial system. Fellows are not required to be working on their idea full-time, but must have shown commitment to developing their idea.

 This unique programme brings together the Lab’s expertise in incubating disruptive financial innovation and Toynbee Hall’s understanding of financial exclusion and exploitation. Unlike intensive location-based incubators, the Fellowship programme consists of six monthly sessions and two weekend-long residential leadership retreats, allowing participants to learn from real-life experience.

 Anna Laycock, Executive Director of the Finance Innovation Lab, commented:

 Carl Packman, Research and Good Practice Manager at Toynbee Hall, added:

 The call for applications is open until 10 April and the Fellowship programme begins in May 2017. Full information about the programme, eligibility criteria and an online application form can be found at www.financeinnovationlab.org/fellowship.

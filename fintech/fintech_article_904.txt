Ovum Highlights New Big-Data Search Technology

March 15, 2017

Technology research company Ovum has shone its spotlight on new big data precision search tool Nalytics.com, stating that its precision search and discovery platform could be the answer for companies looking for a search solution which does not require a big investment in IT infrastructure.

 In its “On the Radar” report on Nalytics, Ovum says, ‘Nalytics provides rich functionality to organisations that need a lightweight tool for searching and analyzing select sets of files and content’. Ovum believes that there is a distinct need in the market for analysis of curated data sets, which provide a stepping stone for businesses working their way up to multifaceted, real-time, and high volume big-data analytics environments.

 David Rivett, COO of Nalanda Technology said: “The Ovum report rightly highlights the fact that end users often spend hours of work-time searching for data they need because they do not have permission, or the budget, to leverage high-powered search platforms. For organisations and individuals granular enterprise search often appears out of reach. Most tools require an accompanying platform that might be prohibitively expensive, or loaded with unneeded functionality – that is not the case with Nalytics.”

 He added: “I am delighted Ovum has recognised that the Nalytics platform provides a middle ground for advanced text analysis. The Solution enables any size of organisation, as well as individuals, to tap into the power of selected sets of content with enterprise-grade power using a ‘curated content’ methodology, in which only high-value and high-quality textual datasets are ingested.”

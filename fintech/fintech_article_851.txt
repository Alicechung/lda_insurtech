Innovate Finance members will be joining a RegTech delegation to New York City this week, organised by the Department for International Trade (DIT). This is DIT’s first RegTech mission to America and will be part of New York’s inaugural FinTech week.

 Leading RegTech firms were selected to take part in the mission. They include Innovate Finance members ClauseMatch, ComplyAdvantage, Encompass Corporation, Percentile, Enforcd, Novastone, FundApps and Sybenetix.

 RegTech companies will be given the opportunity to network and meet leaders from the US market and NYC’s financial services industry and to take part in several workshops and meetings.

 Jane Walshe, CEO and Co-Founder of Enforcd, said:  “I’m much looking forward to flying the flag for British RegTech during this trade mission.  The opportunity to discuss Enforcd with financial institutions as well as regulators including the CFTC and the Fed is unparalleled.  The timing is great for us as we are building out our service to cover the USA, with a view to helping US firms unpack the complicated regulatory and enforcement structure they have to deal with.”

 Roger Carson, Co-Founder and Global Financial Sales Director, Encompass Corporation said: “This mission will be of enormous benefit to our businesses as we look expand globally, and into the North American market in particular.  We’re also delighted to have the opportunity to showcase the exciting developments in RegTech that are happening here in Scotland.”

 9/11 Memorial & Museum and Innovate Finance are also scheduled to host a forum on cybersecurity during the inaugural FinTech Week in New York City. The event will be featuring leading cybersecurity speakers such as Philip Reitinger of the Global Cyber Alliance and Ciaran Martin of the National Cyber Security Centre.

Exscudo Successfully Launches EON Blockchain Testnet

October 5, 2017

We are extremely excited to launch EON blockchain testnet today! Finally, after months of hard work, coding and internal testing, we have launched the public testnet.

 EON is a flexible new generation blockchain technology created by Exscudo to gain independency from the third-party developers. It addresses typical blockchain problems of low transaction per second bandwidth and extensive memory usage by the whole blockchain platform. EON is the fuel that empowers the whole Exscudo ecosystem, enabling integration and proper functioning of all services within a joint network.

 Testnet is the early version of EON blockchain. Our developers already did the internal testing, but a lot still have to be done until the launch of the main net. Public testing of the blockchain functionality is another important step in the building of EON platform. As we already mentioned, testnet will have several stages. Now is the first one, and the starting functionality available for the users is limited to transactions testing.

 We want to encourage more users to participate in our testnet. Take a chance to experience the innovative blockchain technology today!

Nava Finance Implements Sphonic’s Risk Management Software As It Prepares For The Launch Of Its Platform

January 26, 2017

Nava Finance Ltd, which is set to launch a new consumer lending platform in early 2017, has today announced an agreement with risk management company, Sphonic.

 Launched in 2011, Sphonic provides an innovative digital risk and compliance platform and specialist consulting services to financial institutions across Europe.

 Drawing on data from the largest set of sources of any vendor in the market, Sphonic is able to develop a detailed ‘digital picture’ of a consumer, business or transaction and use this information to effectively identify cases of fraud and to minimise risk.

 As an online lending platform, Nava will benefit from integration of Sphonic’s core product, Workflow Manager (WFM), which provides a range of services including Anti Money Laundering (AML), fraud prevention and risk management.

 Since its inception, Nava has taken a sophisticated approach to data and will apply intensive credit analytics to tailor more attractive loans to an underserved mainstream customer market. Sphonic’s support will offer greater protection to Nava and its customers throughout this process and ensure it has the necessary security and fraud prevention measures in place to safeguard its operation.

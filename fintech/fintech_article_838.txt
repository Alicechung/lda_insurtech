May 4, 2017

LendIt Europe 2017 launched last night with a cocktail reception for 75 of London’s fintech elite at the Dion in St. Paul’s. The 2017 event is set to be Europe’s largest lending and fintech event, with over 1,000 participants from the UK and Continental Europe as well as North America and Asia.

 Taking place at the Intercontinental O2 Hotel on October 9-10, this year’s conference is expanding with the industry to cover the hottest topics in fintech including blockchain, insurtech, digital banking, and much more.

 “We are delighted to be back in London for the fourth annual LendIt Europe event”, said Peter Renton, Lendit Chairman. “Building off the success of our US and China events, LendIt Europe will bring together fintech leaders from across Europe and around the globe for two intense days of learning, networking and deal making.”

 Early confirmed keynote speakers are Jaidev Janardana, CEO of Zopa, Francesco Brenna, Partner at IBM Global Business Services, and Shane Williams, co-founder of UBS Smartwealth. With six tracks of content including Digital Banking, Credit & Underwriting, Policy & Regulation, The Cutting Edge in Fintech, Innovations in Lending, and Investor Insights, this year’s LendIt Europe agenda will be the most comprehensive yet, with more details being released on www.lendit.com/europe in the coming months.

 A featured component to this year’s conference, and back for its second year running, is the PitchIt startup competition. PitchIt allows innovative fintech startups from across EMEA to present their solution in front of the LendIt audience of international investors and industry leaders. The PitchIt programme has been an exciting part of the LendIt series of events, with past winners and finalists going on to secure significant investment and publicity.

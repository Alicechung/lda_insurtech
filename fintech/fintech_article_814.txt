 “Our goal with this agenda was to identify the leaders and innovators shaping the future of money. In addition to content focussed purely on developments in payments (such as mobile payments and payment infrastructures) and banking (PSD2, AI, UX, APIs and open platforms), our coverage will include cutting-edge and real world applications of the blockchain (such as for digital identities and loyalty propositions), the sharing economy, virtual reality and the Internet of Things. The premise behind this is to create a dialogue across different industry verticals with the aim of continually pushing forward the boundaries encompassing the financial services and payments sector.”
– Pat Patel, Content Director, Money20/20 Europe

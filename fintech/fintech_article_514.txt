 JOBLIFT PUBLISHES REPORT ANALYSING UK STARTUPS IN COMPARISON TO EUROPEAN NEIGHBOURS

 Berlin/Hamburg, 1st November 2017 – Job meta-search engine Joblift has conducted the European Startup Report 2017 – an extensive insight into the job markets and working conditions in four of Europe’s major startup hubs. Joblift’s report uses job vacancy data from the 1st September 2016 to 1st September 2017, alongside survey answers from around 500 interviewees to focus on every aspect of the British startup workplace. Given the competition from other European countries on the UK’s startup title and Joblift’s presence in these regions, the UK’s results have been compared with those of Germany, France, and the Netherlands.

 THE UK’S STARTUP JOB MARKET HAS INCREASED AT DOUBLE THE NATIONAL RATE WITH LONDON HOUSING 24% MORE JOBS THAN BERLIN
Around 49,000 startup job vacancies were posted in the UK between 1st September 2016 and 1 st September 2017. These vacancies saw a 4% average monthly growth, on par with Germany, and double the 2% increase seen in the UK’s job market as a whole. London dominates in both the UK and Europe, with a 44% share of all startup jobs in Britain and 24% more vacancies than closest competitor Berlin. In addition, Britain leads when it comes to career prospects; 80% of the surveyed startup employees agreed that their startups offered good job growth opportunities, compared to just 61% of German, 62% of Dutch, and 67% of French respondents who felt the same.

 THE AVERAGE STARTUP SALARY IS OVER £10,000 MORE THAN UK AVERAGE BUT WOMEN EARN 25% LESS THAN MALE COLLEAGUES
According to the report, the average wage for a UK startup employee is £37,209 – over
£10,000 more than the national average. Despite this, a fourth of all survey respondents were not satisfied with their salary package. The pay gap in UK startups is particularly apparent; female employees earn 25% less than their male colleagues, who earn £44,900, on average. Unsurprisingly, only 44% of female employees regarded their salary as fair, compared to 68% of men.

 WHILE 81% OF EMPLOYEES HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DISCRIMINATION, ONE IN FIVE HAVE WITNESSED DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOUR IN THEIR STARTUP
Despite women making up 49% of the UK’s startup workforce, only 29% of leadership
positions are held by women. With this in mind, 14% of UK startup employees have
experienced discrimination in their startup, 9% of which was in the form of sexism.
Respondents reported discriminatory comments, and gender related jokes as the forms of sexism experienced. Furthermore, a fifth of startup employees in the UK have witnessed discrimination in their workplace, a result which was mirrored in Germany.

 FREE BEER AND LONG HOURS; UK STARTUP EMPLOYEES WORK LONGEST HOURS
With a 49-hour average week, British startup employees work the longest hours compared to Germany, France, and the Netherlands where collectively employees work an average of 44 hours each week. On the other hand, the UK trumps its European neighbours when it comes to free beer; 88% of British startups offer employees free alcohol as a perk, compared to 76% in Germany, 55% in the Netherlands, and just 52% in France.

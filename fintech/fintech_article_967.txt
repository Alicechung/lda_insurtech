FinTech Fortnight Launches in February 2017

January 6, 2017

The first ever ‘FinTech Fortnight’ is launching in February 2017, drawing attention to this rapidly advancing sector which is impacting and evolving all aspects of finance.

 FinTech is becoming more revolutionary, and incrementally more important; a recent study by PWC theorised that FinTech will be an industry in its own right within a few years, and could constitute a quarter (25%) of the global financial industry eventually. The same study concluded that the financial sector is at a tipping point; Fintech is shaping the financial sector from the outside in, however commentators from traditional institutions argue that they are also responsible for progressing FinTech from the inside out.

 An independent report published in February 2016 ranked the UK as the world number one FinTech hub; this is ahead of the likes of Silicon Valley in the USA. The report cited investment, the nature of the UK’s governmental regulation and its particularly accommodating policies as key factors to FinTech’s success in the UK.

 FinTech Fortnight is a celebration of everything FinTech which sees start-ups through to market leaders discussing and raising awareness of this transformational sector. We are delighted to be working with key players across the market including leading start-ups and major financial institutions, including the ICAEW and Nationwide Building Society.

Yandex.Checkout, Russia’s leading online payment service, has enabled Russians to prepay for their Renault cars online. Renault.ru online store offers its customers a variety of 2016 vehicles, which are now available for booking and prepayment via the store website.

 Earlier this year Renault Russia launched an online prepayment pilot for its Renault Kaptur crossover. Russian users can now prepay for other vehicles: Logan, Sandero, Sandero Stepway, Duster and Fluence. The sum of the payment cannot exceed 30 000 rubles (~$500). The payment can be made via any bank card – without any additional fees.

 Renault.ru is now collaborating with 60 dealers in 35 cities in Russia. The company is planning to expand in Russia adding prepayment for other services and car parts.

 According to the latest data by Yandex.Money, the number of Russians ordering car parts and accessories online this year has increased by 80%.

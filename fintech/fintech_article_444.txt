Clarida Technologies raises €5 million of capital at a €100 million valuation

January 7, 2018

Clarida Technologies Ltd., a UK incorporated technology company offering highly advanced big data-discovery software products and services to a wide variety of industries, is pleased to announce their recent acceptance of an equity investment of €5 million from a private investor which values the company at €100 million.

 Robin Poelmans, CEO, and co-founder of Clarida Technologies states: “We have never actively solicited for external investment into Clarida Technologies mainly because we were wary about getting pushed towards a direction we do not necessarily want to go to.

 This investment is a deal we like; it has a simple structure where the control remains in our hands, no sneaky clawback clauses, we have the freedom to buy-out the investor and it is an investor that understands the added value we can bring.

 Over the past few years, we have received multiple investment offers, some higher than this one, which we simply refused for not being comfortable with the terms and conditions.

 With this additional backing, we intend to invest in expanding our team, focus on introducing our products and services internationally and continue the development of several products that we are currently working on. The value that our products and services can bring to organisations has been proven and those that place innovation as a priority are already reaping the benefits thereof. We finished this product suite earlier this year and want to focus our efforts now on the shift from being mostly concerned about creating the most powerful data-discovery product possible towards commercializing it at scale and providing organisations the tools to convert a ubiquitous commodity, their data, into one of their most valuable assets.”

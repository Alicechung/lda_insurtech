Earlymarket Welcomes Engenie Into Their Portfolio

September 18, 2017

Earlymarket participated in Engenie’s Series A round, which was successfully closed in August this year.

 Engenie is focusing on providing high-power rapid charging facilities for vehicles, and have already completed seven rapid charging point installations. They plan on being the first EV operator in the UK to partner with a bus manufacturer to design an electrified bus route capable of charging buses both en route and at route endpoints. The Earlymarket team is very excited to welcome the company into their portfolio, keeping in line with their socially conscious investment strategy and their passion to facilitate innovative solutions in the mobility sector.

 Both Engenie and Earlymarket are pleased with the current traction and the positive developments in the EV market. Engenie has entered the sector at an opportune time and they have the right team, expertise, and network. Jeremy Littman, the founder of Engenie, predicts; ‘the EV uptake will be quicker than current Government forecasts. The business is currently putting in place key strategic partners to ensure it has the capability to roll out an aggressive infrastructure operation.’

 ‘Engenie are delighted to announce Earlymarket as a key Round A investor. The investment will allow the business to hire some key positions as well as to begin the installation of phase I of their charge point programme. Earlymarket brings a wealth of experience to the table, particularly within the IT and property sectors. Engenie look forward to working closely with the Earlymarket management team as the business grows.’

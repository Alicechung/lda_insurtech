11:FS is pleased to announce the opening of their first US office in New York City, and that Sam Maule is joining the team as Managing Partner for Americas from August 7th.

 Growing our international reach

 At 11:FS we are continuing our drive to become the worldâ€™s best challenger to existing banking suppliers. We help the large players to build new banks and propositions customers love. Learning from our efforts and achievements over the last year in Europe, and to assist with growing our reach, we have taken the next step to open an Americas division.

 New York City was the natural choice for our base, being the financial heart of North America with access to all the biggest banks and services in the industry. We believe there are huge amounts of players in North America who need the type of services that 11:FS can provide in this space and a US presence will help us connect with them.

 In order to help us achieve this, industry heavy hitter Sam Maule has joined the team as Americas Managing Partner. Formerly of NTT Data, and host of FinTech5, Sam is a fantastic addition to the team and will be essential in establishing 11:FS in North America and Canada. With years of experience in banking, Fintech and digital, and named as one of the top 100 most influential Fintech leaders of 2016, Sam is exactly what we need to help 11:FS reach the next level in the Americas.

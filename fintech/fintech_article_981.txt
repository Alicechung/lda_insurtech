Leading health and wellbeing company unveils strategy to support start-ups

December 15, 2016

Westfield Health is inviting start-ups and entrepreneurs from the health and wellbeing sector to pitch for partnership, investment and business support opportunities with the company.

 The leading health and wellbeing company is calling on entrepreneurs to identify the ways it can support their new business growth, and how they could work together to benefit the health and wellbeing of the wider population.

 Commercial Director at Westfield Health, David Capper, said:

 The process will involve an initial 500-word application outlining details of the start-up business. Shortlisted applicants will then have the chance to pitch their business plan, which will be evaluated by a team at Westfield Health.

 Applications will be assessed in January, and successful applicants will be invited to meet Westfield Health representatives to pitch their business proposal in the new year.

 David added,

 Westfield Health has around 400,000 customers and 8,000 corporate relationships.

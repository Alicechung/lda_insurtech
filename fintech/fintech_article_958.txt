The annual UKBAA Winter Investment Dinner returns on 22nd February 2017, this year hosted high above the heart of the City of London on the 42nd floor of The Leadenhall Building (The Cheesegrater) – and The Fintech Times readers can benefit from a special 10% discount on tickets.

 The UKBAA Winter Investment Dinner welcomes a range of guests from the angel and early-stage finance ecosystem, including private investors, angel groups and syndicates, fund managers, crowdfunders, disruptive entrepreneurs and established thought leaders. At last winter’s dinner, UKBAA was delighted to welcome some of the most inspiring and pioneering leaders in the industry.

  

 An outstanding speaker has been lined up for the occasion: David J. Brown, co-founder and CEO of Ve Interactive. Under David’s leadership, Ve Interactive has been listed as one of Europe’s unicorns and named the fastest-growing tech company in the UK by The Sunday Times’ Tech Track 100.

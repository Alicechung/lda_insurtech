How would you respond to a cyber attack? Have you thought through a response to being hacked? Or wannacried? Or phish hooked like a prize haddock?

 Do you have a suitably thought through plan in place? A pre emptive strategy lined up? Your plan stored on paper because your systems might be shut down or locked out? Legal obligations known and insured? Disclosure obligations understood? Supplier contracts suitably covered? Client contracts suitably covered? Everyone knows what to do, what not to do, when to do it and who is responsible for ensuring a minimum of disruption? All covered?

 Yes? Nothing to see here then.

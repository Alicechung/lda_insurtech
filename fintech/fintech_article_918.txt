Payworks’ integrated POS solution taken on by SIX Payment Services

February 23, 2017

Payworks, a leading provider of cloud-based Point of Sale technology, and SIX Payment Services (SIX), leading Swiss and Austrian acquirer and provider of the mPOS solution mCashier, continue their partnership with the integration of the white label software development kit (SDK) for mCashier.

 With the SDK working as an extension of the mPOS solution, SIX is able to open mCashier up to Independent Software Vendors (ISV) in order to offer third-party integration. This easy and streamlined process allows merchants who are taken on by the ISV to receive the standard online on-boarding and can use their mCashier accounts to accept payments right away.

 The mPOS solution, mCashier, powered by Payworks’ latest payment gateway technology, allows merchants to transform their smartphone or tablet into a convenient payment terminal, ensuring customers can make purchases using credit or debit cards. mCashier was even the payment solution at this year’s world famous Hahnenkamm Races in Kitzbühl, Austria for the second year straight.

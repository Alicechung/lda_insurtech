Moneyhub Enterprise launches new ‘nudges’ technology surfacing key personal finance insights directly to the user

March 14, 2017

Moneyhub Enterprise has developed a new “Nudges” product for personal finance apps, which continuously syncs and curates the customer’s key financial data into user friendly cards as they log in to their account.

 The creator of financial technologies for businesses and their customers believes the days of static PFM tools are numbered, and has created this technology in response to consumers’ needs for financial information in easy-to-digest formats. The Nudges technology can be bought ‘off-the-shelf’ or customised and incorporated into new or existing personal finance apps.

 

 Moneyhub Enterprise’s Chief Product Officer, Dan Scholey, explained: “Finances are complicated and consumers are busy, so the industry has to keep up with their needs or risk being left behind. Our vision is to create solutions which will help enterprises and their consumers both now and in the future, and we feel that the deciphering and curation of financial data is the next stage on this journey.”

 Momentum UK is Moneyhub Enterprise’s first client to launch the technology on its personal finance app, ‘Momentum Moneyhub’. The financial services provider wanted to help their customers understand their personal data better as part of their mission to help enhance the overall ‘Financial Wellness’ of their customers, and felt that a focal point on their app would encourage this.

 Dominic Baliszewski, Director of Consumer Strategy at Momentum UK, commented,

Each year, the Blockchain Conference has grown significantly. In 2017, it is expected between 700-1000 participants throughout London Blockchain Week. The audience is a mix of the Fintech ecosystem that specialises in Blockchain & DLT, as well as a senior audience from enterprise, start-ups, VC firms, media, government and academia.

 Blockchain Week kicks off with the Hack-The-Block Blockchain Hackathon at Launch 22. The challenge is simple, use Blockchain/DLT technology in a practical solution for a financial or business solution. There’s still time to get involved as a sponsor, mentor or judge.

 The original Blockchain Conference is back. We launched the first Blockchain Conference in 2015, since then we have taken the event to New York, Hong Kong, San Francisco and many other cities. The 3rd Annual Blockchain London Conference will take place during London Blockchain Week. This year, the event will span 2 day. The first day will lean slightly towards Public Blockchain, while the second day will focus more on Blockchain/DLT in hybrid and public ledgers.

  

 

 JANUARY 25-26 2017

 While the conference is great for keeping up to date with the latest trends from top industry experts, people who would like a deeper dive into Blockchain/DLT can attend workshops on topics including, Smart Contracts, Ethereum and BigchainDB, to name a few. We’ve dedicated Wednesday and Thursday to learning. Space is limited. Workshops will take place at Cocoon Networks.

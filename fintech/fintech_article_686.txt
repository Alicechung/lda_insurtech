The Future of General Insurance to host leaders in insurance innovation from across the whole of Europe

July 26, 2017

Over the past 17 years The Future of General Insurance has established itself as a must-attend event for insurance executives and their partners. But this year it looks a little different.

 The conference was held for the first time in 2001 as an event where decision makers in insurance could discuss critical industry developments and form new relationships.

 In 2017 we will have a broader collection of speakers and delegates than ever before, drawing on leaders in insurance innovation from across the whole of Europe.

 The event’s carefully constructed agenda includes a wide array of topics and perspectives to broaden your knowledge and give you a fully comprehensive experience; from the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution to envisioning a driverless future, we cover it all! Pick and mix your sessions to tailor your agenda with the choice of 5 stages: INNOVATION, MOTOR, PITCH, MARKETING & CLAIMS.

 Enjoy the chance to delve deeper into these hot topics with insights from traditional leaders such as Zurich, Allianz and ERGO. You will also have the opportunity to be challenged by insurtech heavyweights including Scott Walchek, Chief Executive Officer, Trōv and Steven Mendel, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder, Bought By Many!

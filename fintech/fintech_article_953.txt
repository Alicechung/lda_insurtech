Car Repair Startup Secures $1M In Funding

January 27, 2017

UK-based startup ClickMechanic, an online based marketplace for car mechanics, has announced it has closed a $1m funding round. The oversubscribed round was led by leading early stage VC studio Forward Partners, along with 500 Startups, and a number of renowned angel investors, including Klaus Nyengaard (former CEO of JustEat and Chairman of Treatwell). 

 Launched by Andrew Jervis, a 31 year old entrepreneur and business partner Felix Kenton, ClickMechanic was founded after Andrew spoke to his brother, himself a mechanic, who mentioned the concerns that many consumers had around sourcing a trustworthy and ‘cost-transparent’ mechanic to fix their car.  

 Intrigued by the issue, Andrew decided to investigate further and was driven to undertake a research masters degree into the issues within the automotive repair industry.  Following graduation, Andrew met Felix who shared his enthusiasm for disrupting the space. The pair decided to team up and developed ClickMechanic with the goal of building the easiest and most transparent way for car owners to book trusted mechanics, with a clear pre-agreed price attached to work undertaken. 

 Today, the website allows its customers to obtain a free instant fixed price quote for the repair work required and also enables them to book their job with a network of pre-approved UK car workshops and mechanics. Customers can choose to have their car repaired at home or work negating the need for inconvenient trips to the garage.

 The $1m capital injection will enable the business to develop and grow its teams  across marketing, operations and engineering whilst also funding the continued development of the ClickMechanic product, fuelling further growth.

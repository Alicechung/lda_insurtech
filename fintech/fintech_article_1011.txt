Early Metrics, the rating agency for startups, presents TeskaLabs

November 24, 2016

TeskaLabs has developed a scalable enterprise security solution for mobile and IoT applications that protects businesses from getting hacked through their own mobile applications and IoT devices. TeskaLabs has a lead over its rivals with its scalability, cloud service compatibility, easy integration and its ability to handle large scale apps with high volume of users.

 The service is a key differentiator to existing products solutions. The founder brings expertise in enterprise security, mobile applications and has a thorough understanding of the factors influencing the cybersecurity market. Since participating in Techstars London 2015, TeskaLabs has been able to build a healthy commercial pipeline with customers in Czech Republic, UK and Germany. Earlier this year, the company had to redefine their go-to market strategy, individual roles and specific responsibilities of the managing partners. Despite the long business cycles, the firmâ€™s speed to market has been impressive and TeskaLabs has been able to develop a strategic partnership with a leading mobile carrier. Proposed milestones for the next 6-12 months are to develop the IoT security product, optimise the customer service and monitoring capabilities and an increased focus on sales.

September 14, 2017

Andrew Zimine’s speech at the Nextgen Payments & Regtech Leaders Forum was successful. Andrew Zimine was happy to take part in this inspiring event and his speech attracted the attention of many participants.

 Andrew was invited to the NGP & Regtech Leaders Forum as a keynote speaker. This time he talked about revolutionary blockchain scalability solutions, one of the hottest issues within the crypto community. Andrew started with an overview of already existing scalability solutions introduced by Bitcoin and Ethereum, and then presented a new approach developed and implemented in Exscudo ecosystem: the “scaling down” method relative to the status of all the accounts and their balances – then the net starts from this snapshot. Every snapshot has its own hash, because after some time it will be followed by another one and so on.

 We were happy to meet representatives of leading European fintech associations at the event. We have discussed further collaboration with Tony Craddock, Director General of Emerging Payments Association (EPA) and Dr. Subas Roy, Chairman of the International RegTech Association.

 This event opens a cycle of Andrew Zimine’s speeches about the hottest trends in fintech and cryptocurrency. Andrew is a recognized expert on blockchain technologies and decentralized cryptographic data transfer networks, consulting expert on DAPS Ethereum with over 8 years of experience in the management of companies. He has over 18 years of experience in IT technologies and their integration into the real sector of the economy.

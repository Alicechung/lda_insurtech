July 27, 2017

27 July 2017, Cambridge, UK – Online investment platform, SyndicateRoom today announces that it’s giving its members the opportunity to take part in a retail bond offer for LendInvest, the leading marketplace for property lending and investing.

 Under the offer, LendInvest proposes the issue of sterling-denominated 5.25% fixed-rate retail bond notes, which are due in 2022, by its wholly-owned subsidiary, LendInvest Secured Income plc. LendInvest is the guarantor of the retail bonds, which will be secured by way of a floating charge over the whole of the undertaking and all property, assets and rights, both present and future, of LendInvest Secured Income plc.

 LendInvest has a distinctive lending model that aims to create a cleaner, quicker and more flexible borrower experience for professional property investors and developers. Leveraging its team’s mortgage underwriting experience, loan servicing track record, and its proprietary technology-enabled tools and processes, the company believes it is able to match the demands of professional bridging finance borrowers, who frequently require rapid turnaround times.

 LendInvest believes it has filled a funding gap in the UK’s mortgage market. As at 31 March 2017, the total principal amount of loans provided by the Group since it commenced operations in 2008 (excluding extensions) was £811.34 million.

 “This is a particularly exciting deal for us, as it’s the first time we’ve offered our members access to a retail bond and is the latest example of SyndicateRoom paving the way for private investors into the public markets,” commented Tom Britton, Co-founder of SyndicateRoom.

 “By giving our members access to yet another type of offering we’re allowing our investors further opportunity to diversify their portfolios. The announcement also adds to our vision of connecting our members with great businesses – and as a leading fintech company which aims to provide borrowers with a better experience in a tough lending environment, LendInvest is an ideal fit.”

 “In an era of record low interest rates coupled with constrained bank lending, we’ve developed a unique and compelling proposition for investors by offering access to a sought after asset class delivering compelling returns. As we continue to scale the business, we’re increasingly looking to create new entry points to an attractive asset class that suits a broader range of investors seeking competitive risk-adjusted returns.

 The launch of this Bond allows us to achieve both of these ambitions, supporting future growth goals”, said Christian Faes, Co-Founder & CEO of LendInvest.It’s great to be working with Syndicate Room as one of our Authorised Offerors in what we think is a first tie-up of its kind between two fintech businesses. The company’s partnership with the London Stock Exchange made SyndicateRoom a natural fit to join us for the deal.

 This is the first time we have seen newer fintech platforms working closely alongside the old guard of the investment management world to provide access to investment opportunities in this way, and it’s working well.”The offer will close in SyndicateRoom’s platform on 2 August at midnight. The bond’s total offer period is expected to close on 4 August at noon.

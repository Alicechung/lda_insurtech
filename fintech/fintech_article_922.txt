February 14, 2017

The UK’s leading recruitment finance provider, Sonovate, has funded £156m of the UK recruitment sector since its launch in 2014. This announcement highlights the company’s rapid growth and continued dominance across the sector.

 Richard Prime, co-founder and co-CEO of Sonovate, commented,

 Founded by former recruiters Prime and co-founder Damon Chapple, Sonovate provides flexible finance free of all-turnover agreements and concentration limits, as well as the associated back office contractor management technology to recruitment companies placing contractors.

 Widely recognised as a game changer, Sonovate is an alternative to the non-negotiable terms and impersonal service offered by UK banks and has transformed the recruitment industry and the way it funds contract workers.

 Since launch, Sonovate has signed up nearly 1000 agencies and written off just £2,700 in bad debt – 0.000001% of the total lent, and significantly less than that of Funding Circle (8%) and Market Invoice (1.2%). In the final quarter of 2016 alone, the company signed up 168 new recruitment agencies and continues to grow at over 20% a month – this year 88% of recruitment start-ups that have taken finance used Sonovate. Sonovate’s team is now 116 people strong, up from just 25 last year.

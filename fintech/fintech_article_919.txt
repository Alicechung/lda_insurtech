 London/Macedonian-based startup Cognism has secured $500,000 in seed investment to fund development of its state of the art solution that provides sales organisations with a more efficient and privacy compliant way to prospect customers. The round, which was led by Netcetera, will be used to scale the Cognism team and further develop its core solution. Several other institutional and angel investors participated in the round including SC Ventures, Tsingbay Venture Capital, Tom James, James Hodson, Usman Khan and others.

 Lead generation, data enrichment, and targeting prospects requires time, effort, and an ongoing investment. All too often, time and energy is spent on this phase of the sales process, rather than on closing deals. Data protection and legal restrictions on customer outreach are also rapidly evolving, this further challenges the ability of sales teams to connect with customers.  To assist the sales cycle, many companies, especially those with limited resources, are turning to automated sales-acceleration technology to improve the prospecting process and ensure outreach compliance in the target market.
